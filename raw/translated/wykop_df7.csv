0,"               I AM EVERYWHERE, THERE IS A THERMOMODERNIZATION PROGRAM, as everybody else, and insulate styrofoam with houses during refurbishments. Let them think more about the availability of infrastructure, so that you do not have to kick with coal - to start with, expanding the gas and city network from which blocks in cities are heated, or cheap electricity / oil for heating purposes.  Such problems are primarily a matter of infrastructure and not giving away money, as it will be an infra-red for many people to give up because it is better to have maintenance-free heating or hot water. After all, they suggest that people, if they have insulated houses, will be less warm?

1,"               We have been coping with coal since the beginning of EU membership and only now are they reminded that we are breaking the law? xD It's good that 10-15 years ago there were no air sensors because I think the scale would go out.  By the way - I would prefer that these alleged 4 billion penalties went into heating infrastructure, a larger percentage of individual connections to the municipal heating network and the possibility of connecting to the gas network because this is fraught even in cities. I do not know about you, but I would rather pay a little more to press the button and have hot and warm water in the tap - without smoke, without guarding the stove, without throwing ash.  #smog #se #heating #poland show the whole source: 20180222_104736.jpg   +: D ....... k, porBorewicz07 +16 others  ",2018-02-22 11:49:38,MarianoaItaliano,18,

19,"               I bought a LOOKO2 sensor. The more expensive for PLN 950. I like Polish solutions and I support them. But every day I am thinking more and more about the correctness of this air quality sensor. I have already written to the boys a dozen e-mails with proposals for solutions and amendments. And new ones are coming out every day.  I am an electronics technician, so I was happy to look at the ""inside"" of this Polish electronic thought. The whole works under the control of a simple but giving the possibilities of ESP8266. Simple voltage stabilization, programming connector, RGB diodes signaling the air condition (4 pieces shine all in the same color, I will write further why) and a connected sensor of suspended particles. It is he who measures PM 1, 2.5, 10, formaldehyde levels, temperature and humidity.  And the first thing is that the temp / humidity sensor is inside the module. And therefore, the indications refer to the climate inside the box rather than outside. My phone shows -2C, car -3C, and LookO2 ... 12C :-)  HCHO level. For the first few days, these indications were not supported at all by their website, the API was not even variable. It appeared on Friday. Indication: stable 0. No one knows what, whether particles per million or something else. It's just zero. Only that zero is probably not possible in our time. WHO has determined 0.05ppm as the upper norm, 0.03 reportedly being ""all the time"" in the air. Well, as it shows 0 it probably is zero :-) Like 12C :-)  RGB LEDs - show a good state of air according to the CIEP's findings. Cool! You do not really need to go on the web, just look at the sensor and you already know. Diode is 4 pcs, all are lit at once. I wondered why anyway. I have read the warranty and have already learned: ""Damage to one, two or three diodes is not covered by the warranty."" The record is of course unimportant in accordance with the law (I would advise the boys to remove it so that someone would not cross and did not send to the OCCP), otherwise to undermine the simple non-conformity of the goods with the contract. After 5 days of use with 4, only one lamp shines: -0 Someone did not want to calculate the resistance on the diodes.  I'm cheering as much as I can, but I lose some of my hope from day to day that they may be able to stay longer. It's a pity, because Airly's typically Krakow policy does not suit me so much that I would not buy this solution.  #smog #electronics #industry show all   +: Health-oriented, slavas +2 others  ",2018-02-20 10:34:29,lutecki,4,
20,"               Some time ago I came to my hometown for a moment. I passed the fuel depot and the whole neighborhood was covered with biting, yellow smoke. At first I wanted to call the municipal police, but I decided that I would not do it.  Instead of complaining to the authorities right away, I decided to take the oil lamp - I went to the guy and fucked him, that he was stalking us all, that he smoked the whole area, and you can see that he sells wet coal. I was expecting a foch, but the guest asked ""what should I do?"" I made him an accelerated course of smoking from the top and the benefits of this resulting (both health and economic). The guy grabs what I mean in the flight - almost as quickly as if he just wanted to blow me up. I knew that I would come back that way in 20-30 minutes and if he continued smoking then I would report it immediately.  It somehow happened that I was going past but after about 5-10 minutes. And to my great surprise I saw that only a light balloon comes out of the chimney, and the area has already vented. I was there several times over several days and there was no smoke every time. The guest is probably also now educating their clients, which makes the whole area less crowded.  So, Mirki, I encourage you to sometimes take matters into your own hands before the police or city guards do it. The mandate probably would not teach him anything, and thanks to that, the inhabitants of the area breathe more pure air.  #czujedobrzeczel #chwalesie #smog #bojowkapaleniaodgory  show photo spoiler not mine  show the whole source: wykop.pl   +: Secretary J.0, Pro-healthy +12 others  ",2018-02-20 10:32:36,Bieniuraper,14,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_TosGPUMpTbOJjGEl7IxDXCvJJ0da1SrY,w400.jpg""/>"

111,"               Mr. Klawiatur recently did the Xiaomo Purifier test, I did today a cleansing test that I have: sharp kc-a50euw. The purifier is already working for the second year, in principle 24h / day, during this time I have not exchanged filters - these have a lifespan of 5-10 years, and I have cleaned the carbon filter under running water several times. According to the manufacturer, it provides almost 100% efficiency in air purification from pm 2.5, the maximum airflow is 306 m3 / h. PM 2.5 particles were measured using the Xiaomi detector. And I will tell you that the purifier works perfectly. If you were thinking about buying this type of device for your home, do not hesitate. No point wasting life!  The norm of average daily concentration of pm2.5 is 25 μg / m3.  The cleaned room: 23m3.  Before starting the device, I opened the window for 15 minutes in the room, closed the window and then waited another 15 minutes.  Results Starting value pm 2.5: 50 End value pm. 2.5: 1 Working time: 9 minutes in the highest cleaning mode https://s18.postimg.org/9rrmxehrt/screenshot_1540.png  As a bonus, two readings.

How is the popularity of this man at the excavation?  - Mr. President, smog is awesome, about 800 percent, what solutions do you see? - I suggest nowhere to go out of the house if there is no need. - Looooo bravo, super president!  - Mr. President, the traffic jams are terrible, you can not get anywhere in time, what steps do you want to take? - Well, we'll build these roads once, what we are building now and this viaduct ... we will do something with this viaduct and it will be ok someday. - <the crowd pushes tears of emotion and enthusiasm>  Sure, before 2002, Krakow was certainly the rougher than now, but every city was. show the whole   +: kamalay, jamjamjam +3 others  ",2018-02-12 12:39:42,Wergiliusz,5,

For almost 50 days it was not raining, foggy days and high inversion of temperatures, an orographic trap on three sides, and a drop in temperature by several degrees during the day, contributed to the concentration of pollutants in the cities of northern Italy, which was record high. Milan, Padua, Turin, Verona and Modena suffered from smog. Northern Italy is not accustomed to sudden and prolonged temperature drops. Everyone is heating up and the stone walls require to be heated intensively. The Italian authorities have decided to reduce the heating of municipal housing from 21 to 18 degrees. The difference is considerable. Cars with diesel (although it is known that they are not the main factor in the formation of smog) are often prohibited to enter the city every other day.

166,"               I want to buy an air purifier mainly for use in a room of about 20m2 (flat 78m2 but in use is about 48 meters), for a price of up to PLN 2,500  What brands and models are worth noting for this price? The appearance has a bit of meaning, because in the spring / summer there is an air conditioner in the room and I do not want to put another nasty plastic block next to it.  How, for example, does Dyson Pure Cool Link Tower compare to eg Daikin Ururu and Sharp KC cleaners? Dyson is even a nice decoration, but Daikin or Sharp look like tourist fridges. But, on the other hand, there is probably a reason for that, which is why I wonder how the performance and quality of Dyson's purification compare with traditional equipment and I really have a dilemma ... Well, it's difficult to find a meaningful and comprehensive comparison of several models (͡ ° ʖ̯ ͡ °)  Maybe there is someone who deals with such equipment professionally and will suggest something?

169,"               Ever since I left pracbazy, I am constantly attacked with small but troublesome buds, the accumulation of which makes me want to commit #seppuku with melted cheese -.- So we are going with this Mercy Festival of Fate:  show spoiler On the way to the library, a nice smoker shared with smoke on his cigarette, fortunate that I carry asthma medication with such a wonderful smog. In the library, I borrowed not the book I wanted - as I found out at home - I did not look at what the librarian gave me. I got out of the library happy just to unhappily stumble on a straight surface. According to the rules of physics and Murphy's rights, the phone, which was in the pocket when it fell, fell out of it and, winning two gold medals in the category of man's day ripping, fell onto the pavement. To my good mood, the battery flew to one side, the screen cracked on the cobblestone and the flap flew completely to the opposite direction and some snow fell from the shoulder (· へ ·) instead of the battery. In a moment of luck, I managed to put together and turn on the phone - despite its condition, it lived and acted. Cool. I chose the direction of Rossman because I wanted to take advantage of the promo and buy a spare shampoo #lessbaskpaper but before that I was waiting for the Dębnicki bridge and an unforgettable opportunity to be splashed by a biker who with unspeakable talent splashed a slush puddle on my left leg. Could it be worse? Yes, it was a #prelude to this tragedy. In Rossman, my most wonderful phone, he decided that he had changed his mind, he was bored with the world of living and he just died. Removing and inserting the battery does not help, well, the phone does not work, it is not possible to use the promo. Disappointed I put away the shampoos, I grab the lotion to clean the tub and the lids in a glass bottle and tinker to the cash desk thinking if the blue will be able to resuscitate the phone. The transaction strangely passed, although when I was leaving the cash register, the belt strip stopped. That it would not be good for me when the streetcar with the shopping was coming up stopped and everything landed on the sidewalk. I heard a bloodcurdling sound of breaking glass and a moment later the net began to bleed with juice (ಠ‸ಠ) The tram goes up and I quickly pack the bags into the Bag-Z-Urwanym-Arm bundle. I was so fast that no man in bed would want to be so fast, thank you why at the last moment I got on the tram, which stopped the lights. And in the light of the lights, in the light of the tram lamps, I thought that particles of glass were sinking into my paws and my bloody hands were covered with blood. Searching for the tissues in the Bag-Z-Urwanym-Arm, I discovered that it was not only me bloody but also a lotion for cleaning the bathtub because the glass mercifully pierced the bottle. I felt like he was dying in a circle near me with chlorine. Feeling the puff of sweating in my sweaty stub, I just thought that nobody would think I was spraying CS in eMPeK. On the way from the bus stop to the apartment I was afraid that the piano would fall on me, the microtrient of air would draw me in or that the Black Volga would come and kidnap me (╥﹏╥) Fortunately, I got there.   As a consolation at home I drank tymbark - the caption read ""live boldly"" ...

177,"               As in #wroclaw today some gigantic smog, and the problem is still being downplayed by some, I will re-write the text about my adventure with smog, because with me it's getting better :)  One can say that I was very skeptical about the problem of smog. Not that I did not believe in its destructive properties, but what else to hear and read ""leftist sources"" and yet another thing to see and find out for yourself - nota bene literally.  It so happened that I am a man with quite poor health, since I have been struggling with quite an intense allergy, and for almost a decade with serious kidney disease. Recently, it has been very poor - less and less disease taking on drugs, more and more extensive destruction of the kidneys, increasing hypertension and a general feeling of well-being. Not to mention skin problems, they have always been.  It so happened that in August I went to study in Denmark. And you know what? I feel just sensational - the pressure went down just below the level of ""perfect"" which was still inconceivable in my case some time ago, research is coming out better and everything seems to indicate that the disease may not have been cured, but it has been severely inhibited. The last days in Poland hurt me so much that it rarely happened that I would not take anything painkiller for the night, but nothing here. But the most tangible effect of this change is zero body snot on August. The skin just healed me.  Also shocking for me was the first return to Poland where it was just SMOKING and I was seriously thinking about buying an anti-smog mask. After a few hours I got used to it and it did not bother me that much. The second return was much better and I did not feel such a change, but my sister also told me that I had just arrived at the moment when everything was dispelled by these hurricanes. I am far too distressed for my own country, especially with some ""leftist"" color but unfortunately this is the truth - Poland is a smelly poison of Europe and something must be done about it.  I realize that not all smog must be destructive - just like smoking, some people smoke for the rest of their lives and they are all right. However, you must bear in mind that if today you do not mind, it does not mean that tomorrow you will not get sick. And then every factor matters, especially in which air you are submerged.  Of course, I did not leave because of health, it all happened quite by accident, but unfortunately I have no intention of returning to Poland in the near future permanently because it simply means suicide for me.  #smog #polska #medycyna #neuropa # 4konserwy show whole   +: s_t_u_l_e_j, Emulsion +30 others  ",2018-02-09 16:07:57,peetee,32,
