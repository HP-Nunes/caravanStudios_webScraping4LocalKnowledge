Sometimes, especially when they heard that the standards are to be exceeded by several hundred percent, at a negative temperature, they told me to go outside in my pants, to catch a colder and smog and pollution so bad.

45,"               #msalamon Hello! We have winter and as we know for the past years, #smog is attacking us sharply.

47,"               I went several dozen kilometers yesterday to take a photo of the action #wroclawniestrzela but clouds (or smog) that hung over the city prevented me. There is something like this below, it's not a wonderful photo, but so much I went, it's a pity to add nothing ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯. Behind one of the larger fireworks you can see the characteristic lighting of the Wrocław penis.
