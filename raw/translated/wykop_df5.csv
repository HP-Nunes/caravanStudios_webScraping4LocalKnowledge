2,"               #anonimowemirkowyznania Hi,  TL; DR At the bottom is a link to the survey, but if possible, I would ask you to read the whole.  As usually happens in Poland during the autumn and winter - the theme of smog has come to the lips not only of journalists, but everyone who is forced to inhale poisonous air.  There are some minor movements towards improving the air, such as checking whether the DPF has been cut in the car or the law defining the standards that fuel must meet, but all the time the most important is forgotten ... It's not the cars that generate the most pollutants (as can be evidenced by trace amount of smog in the summer) although they also add their 3 cents. This rubbish burning is what makes us one big red point compared to other European countries. Here, it's not even about image on the international scene. Smog is above all a factor significantly increasing the occurrence of tumors, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diseases and abnormal development in fetuses - the list is long. It is also a loss for Poland, because several billion zlotys are spent annually on the effects of smog treatment, and tens of thousands of people die prematurely (data differ from each other, therefore I wrote approximately, according to the WHO, PLN 8 billion per year and about 40,000 people) .  Due to the fact that for many years almost no one in power deals with this problem seriously (changes in laws and anti-smog programs resemble the administration of vitamins to a person suffering from plague - it does not contribute much), I prepared a questionnaire because I would like to know your position and opinion and every person to whom this questionnaire will reach. I do not have a lot of free time, but if it turns out that more people are ""ZA"" radical changes, I would be ready to prepare the right letter and start collecting signatures.  I know that the question in the survey is controversial, but let's be honest - if we do not put it clearly and absolutely, nothing will change. If so far people who smoke furniture, bottles, etc. have not met the theory that they contribute to the smog, nothing will change it, no campaign and appeals. It is only to receive, for example, several dozen hours of social work, and after subsequent incidents of several thousand zlotys of punishment will trigger the launch of thought processes. In addition, there is a real need to buy modern furnaces, which are much more efficient and minimize the formation of smog. This is not a cheap purchase, so probably without subsidies will not work, but in this case it is better to use the money for subsidies, than to allocate billions for treatment every year.  https://www.strawpoll.me/16785246  #smog #polska #czistepair  Click here to reply in this thread anonymously Click here to send an anonymous private message to OP Post added using the script AnonymousMirkoWyznania (https://mirkowyznania.eu) Accepted: sokytsinolop Appendix supported by: Trips for youth show the whole   +: lubie-cheesecake, ZapalaBuchaZajebajegoHe Bread +6 others  ",2018-11-06 00:12:08,AnonimoweMirkoWyznania,8,

11,"               Heavy industry in China is highly energy inefficient. For example, Chinese steel factories consume 1/5 more energy per ton than the international average. On the other hand, cement factories already needed 45 percent more energy, and ethylene needed 70 percent more than the average. Chinese buildings rarely have good thermal insulation and therefore consume twice as much energy for heating and cooling as in Europe and the United States in similar climates. As much as 95 percent of new buildings in China do not meet national energy efficiency regulations.  If we were to choose the word that best describes the Chinese economy, it would be ineffective. The Chinese economy, in order to produce the same amount of goods (GDP), must issue in turn: - 21 times more CO2 than Swiss - 18 times more CO2 than Swedish - 14 times more CO2 than French - 8 times more CO2 than German / Japanese - 5 times more CO2 than American / Canadian - 4 times more CO2 than Korean - 3 times more CO2 than Czech - 2 times more CO2 than Polish - 1.5 times more CO2 than Russian  Only the economies of 4 countries (Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Mongolia, Uzbekistan) perform worse in this respect.

25,"               Mirki, as the Wykop has a fairly large range, I would like to promote the method of burning coal and wood in the furnace, which until everyone in the country can not afford to replace the furnaces will help reduce the problem of air pollution in an instant. Namely, it is about firing in the oven using the method from above. It is suitable for almost all types of furnaces (see comment below, what is suitable and what is not). There is a belief in the country that the burning of coal must be dirty and kick as hell. Meanwhile, if you kick from the chimney like a steam locomotive, it means that you smoke badly. Together with the smoke, you throw unburned fuel into the atmosphere, which could be burnt in your furnace with another kind of lighting. You save, and at the same time you do not have such an environment. In Poland, there is no reliable research on this subject, while abroad such research has been done and savings on fuel reach 30%, and reduction of 50% pollution (depends on the type of fuel and the smoker's practice). Compilation of tests  What is the advantage of smoking from above over traditional smoking from below? In the burning from the bottom, the entire hopper is immediately heated, the gases contained in the fuel are released, but they have no place to burn, because the heat is at the bottom, near the grate. These gases are flammable, so they could give heat, but in this situation they fly to the chimney unburned and we see them as smoke. Meanwhile, in the burning from the top, under the influence of heat, the gases are released from the fuel and pass through the heat on top, getting better or worse there. Effectiveness of this afterburn depends on how much we will lead the air so-called. secondary to the top of the hopper where combustion takes place, as well as from the boiler structure itself, nevertheless it is always more efficient combustion (i.e. cheaper) than smoking in the same boiler from the bottom. Are there any cons? I see one, when you start a fire once, you can not add a new portion of fuel to the top, it would be burning from below. However, there is a way, so-called rolling walking. The remaining heat is pushed to the back of the hearth, and in the front, it adds fuel so as not to cover the heat. Fuel will then ignite from the current heat. Another method is to select the heat from the furnace and transfer it to the ash box for a moment. Then, we pour new fuel into the furnace, and we throw the embers from the ash pan on top and burns further. As a last resort, if you do not want to play with it all, and you want to avoid kicking, you can add fuel to the surface in small portions.  Finally, I will answer the doubts I have seen on the Internet from people who have heard about this method and questioned its effectiveness. 1. There is no savings on fuel. It's just an illusion that the fuel from the top is burning up longer. This is not an illusion but the reality resulting from combustion physics from above. If you smoke from the bottom you have thick smoke, which is unburned fuel, and burning from above, the smoke is brighter, it means that in the upper combustion more fuel is burned in the furnace instead of being discharged unused by the chimney. Since we get more energy from the same amount of fuel at the upper combustion, it means that to get the same energy yield as in the bottom combustion, we will consume less fuel. 2. I do not have time to wait 2 hours for it to ignite, I want to have warmth at home immediately! This is probably the biggest lie disseminated about this method of smoking and the impression is that mainly by people who have never even tried it and do not want to try, that's why they invent such absurd reasons as this without any translation in practice. I reach the temperature of 60 degrees Celsius in my 14 kW oven in half an hour, then I turn on the pump and the house starts to feel warm. Burning from the bottom you can reach this temperature earlier, but does it cost you to save 30% fuel and reduce the emission of pollutants to the atmosphere at the expense of waiting 15-20 minutes longer for heat?  Little is heard about this method. There are several reasons. Ecological organizations and anti-smog alarms are incensed by the fact that they are coal, so they will not promote cleaner coal because it is still coal. The fact that coal will never be 100% pure fuel, but you can burn it 50% cleaner. Can you imagine that everyone is starting to smoke from the top and pollution indicators in one winter without paying any costs are reduced by half? It's worth trying for me. Producers of boilers is also not worth talking about, because new regulations force in the long run to get rid of old boilers, so-called. trash and buying modern 5th class boilers, therefore it is a profit for producers. Why teach that you can burn more cleanly in an old trash, if you can sell a new boiler for 5-10 thousand PLN? While the trash cost 2,000. Still interesting - do you know how modern 5-class class 5 feeder boilers work? On smoking from above. (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) I have the impression that in the public debate on this topic no one takes into account that smoking is not a whim, but a necessity for many Poles because of exploitation costs. I myself have a gas stove at home, but it has been unused for years, because coal heating is significantly cheaper. Many countrymen suspect I chose coal for the same reason.  I am asking for bugs for coverage, I am ready to discuss.  #smog #ecologia #news #zdrowie #polska #palenieodgory #gruparatowaniapoziomu show whole source: czystogrzewanie.pl   +: slavas, xentropia +764 others  ",2018-11-03 16:53:46,wilku88,766,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_CWChriAiS7rv9LFUvzbtotKPWk8iuxgX,w400.jpg""/>"

The most harmful air pollutants in cities - particles with a diameter of PM 2.5 (or smaller) - belong to the most dangerous, because they easily penetrate into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Caused by emissions from vehicles, factories, structures and combustion of carbon particles increase the risk of cardiovascular ailments, respiratory diseases and lung cancer if people are chronically exposed to them. Cars and trucks are the main source of fine particulate pollution, which is a particular problem in Beijing, where the number of registered cars increased to 5 million in 2011 from 3.5 million in 2008.

The country is largely based on coal to meet its energy demand at 66 percent of the energy mix. In 2014, China consumed around 4 billion tons of coal - more than in the rest of the world combined. Half of Chinese coal is burned in decentralized boilers in the industrial and residential sectors.  In the Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) region, coal consumption in 2014 was almost 1.8 billion tons, which is 40 percent of China's total coal consumption and corresponds to the coal consumption of almost all OECD countries together.  Reducing coal consumption by improving energy efficiency is the key to purifying air in China.

Park a cart, and the first after a hard trip, I start a pipe, I'm somewhere in a place where I am frequented and suddenly booom, some kind of guy who stands nearby approaches, I think, well, handsome, this may want to do a kabanos squat (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) in total it was not some special and I do not know if it would not be a disability because it looked like some LBGTQWERTXYZ, known starter pack colored hair, some leather jacket with studs, few studs were missing because she had them in the mire (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) such a krejzolka free animals, gays and lesbians xD.  Well, but that's nothing, he comes up. The first thing I do is spread out clouds of smog, sulfur fumes and burning tires to get a better look and what I see? typiara has such a mask on her face as a surgeon, that like smog or something? fast rozkumina that maybe some demonstration of freaks from LGBTQWERTXYZ takes place and recruit to this sect, but not because I look like 100% hetero alpha male, also falls out.  After a while, something tapped out or do I have to smoke here, because it bothers her (I add that she stood far enough and up to the wind that she did not have the right to feel the smoke) but ok. Well, then I politely do not have to, I do not have to, but I can and nobody I do not bother because I do not breathe straight into my face (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) how I get so angry and throws that I pollute the air (in Krakow xD) then I go to it further as a man (I do not know, maybe there was a mistake) that after all they are so polluted that it can not be worse anymore and may look for a provocation somewhere else. But no, he still stands and tells me to extinguish a cigarette, and that I ended up I said that ok I will quit, the cigarette is almost dormant, left-winged priest because she managed to impose her fascist opinion on someone, but nooooo, it's not so easy, I pull out the second pipe and I fired him from this dying (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  It is she who says that she is calling the police and that she is not allowed to smoke in a public place, and I think that before I come, I will burn and only discredit her. She gave up (although it does not sound xD) and she went in a piss because I think she felt she would not be able to play here.  And now the question to you, seriously in such a stench that prevails in Krakow, bothers you so much that someone ignites you if you do not smoke at the bus stop just standing around and calmly smokes without disturbing anyone?  I understand that in a place where there is relatively clean air, something can disturb but in Krakow? xD how do you live on a factory boat at a plastic or sewage treatment plant that bothers you too?  It makes me laugh a bit and come to the conclusion that it's not about the smell of roasted tobacco (which everyone does not like) only about ordinary polish coming to something by force and shooting shitbugs xD like a game from which you dare to call the manager, and As you can see, you do not differ mentally too much from these speakers (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  Greetings to those who wanted to read to the end and read willingly about similar stories that you met (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  #tfwnogf #papierosy #krakow #smog #rawn #steelbands #bluebandsbands #videphrase #bekazodlusters #bekazlewactwa #polska show whole   +: W33D420, AnimusAeger999 +3 others  ",2018-10-27 18:43:19,Suck_My_Duck,5,
73,"               I'm going back with the update. As of today, I'm spinning the buffer up to 90 ° C, although it's possible that a few degrees more, because the thermostat is distorting. The central heating pump is on all the time and it heats everywhere, only after the third day I have to add some water, but it probably results from too small tank, which at 85-90 deg. C strongly escapes water overflow. After today's heating, I should start the furnace again on Monday afternoon, with a 27-29 kg coal, a walnut from KWK Ziemowit. Final applications: - it is absolutely necessary to replace the equalizing reservoir, but I am waiting for a professional technician, by the way I am surprised that the conversation was supposed to warm up the buffer to 70-80 ° C, and here, on a partial charge, it warms up to over 90, he did not want to be reckoned or did he shoot a number from his head? - add an electric heater to the CH boiler. After the second day of heating, the temperature from the furnace is enough to heat the house, but not at the CWU anymore  Question for the boiling: is it a standard that the overfilling almost 30 kg of coal burns in 5/6 hours? Before I added the buffer I could smear it up to 13 hours on the blower, although I suspect that half of the fuel went into the chimney.  @ kurzi5 @dziecielinapala @kibiklops @Solitary_Man @OldNoob @Silikon @Serv_HVAC @ anty-fronda @ nintendo89 @kocha_to_poczka @Juzef @kijek_samobijek @Basteq @ jaceks653 @tRNA @ rumun6925 @Trelik @Fafnucek @ PanKracy582 @dump @burtton @ PawelW124 @Astroc #heating #zima #smog show the whole source: IMG_20181027_175208_HHT.jpg   +: PawelW124, OldNoob +18 others  ",2018-10-27 18:11:00,goothic,20,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_IevU0Tfupslv0SpJJQd0FYfd1n7BU4nX,w400.jpg""/>"

76,"               According to the World Bank, the economic burden associated with premature mortality and the incidence of respiratory diseases is very high. Air pollution with particulates (PM 2.5) cost the world economy USD 5.7 trillion, or 4.4 percent of global GDP in 2016.  The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has the highest level of air pollution in China. The World Bank works closely with Hua Xia Bank to help this region fight air pollution by financing business investments to increase energy efficiency, develop clean energy and gradually reduce air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. For this purpose, the World Bank has approved a USD 500 million loan for China.

I got up from the polite time, because at 5:40 am - and that my in-laws do not have any feeding hairs, I started the journey at six o'clock.

Later there was a slight run up to Jordanów and after a while, a sharp pipe down, where I acquired the reserve and speed. Then there was my beloved ascent to the High - just over 3 km of the ideal route with a very pleasant degree of inclination. There, I found this wonderful view of the Tatras ... After a while, beating the land-belt, I moved sharply down - I gained speed again and regained some of the meters focused on the run. In Skawa, one more slightly troublesome ascent, and then already basically flat, downhill and again slightly uphill.

Today, we want to put a stop, once and for all, to the debate about the demise of diesel technology.”  Record readings under real driving conditions: 13 mg NOx per kilometer  Since 2017, European legislation has required that new passenger car models tested according to an RDE-compliant mix of urban, extra-urban, and freeway cycles emit no more than 168 milligrams of NOx per kilometer. As of 2020, this limit will be cut to 120 milligrams. But even today, vehicles equipped with Bosch diesel technology can achieve as little as 13 milligrams of NOx in standard legally-compliant RDE cycles. That is approximately one-tenth of the prescribed limit that will apply after 2020. And even when driving in particularly challenging urban conditions, where test parameters are well in excess of legal requirements, the average emissions of the Bosch test vehicles are as low as 40 milligrams per kilometer. Bosch engineers have achieved this decisive breakthrough over the past few months.  (...)  How will AdBlue consumption be affected?

I've already written, what problems do I have with him because he is too big and has too much power, so change is necessary.  I wanted to give you a little advice on what you would recommend, I am thinking about pellets and eco-peas.  First of all, I would like to be as maintenance-free as possible, cover up for a week, two and have a headache. The boiler room is quite large, so I would like to cover it with the cheapest tiles, and then I think that it would give advice to store the pellets, where it is important that no moisture gets into it.  According to the warmth of the house, about 24kW is needed for my house, so with a pellet option, the stove itself has an output of 10-12 thousand, with a pellet probably 6-7. At the moment, for the season I use 3-4 t of coal + from 2 meters of wood, where I close in some 4,000 a year for heat, because I smoke all year long. Looking at the price of raw material with pellets, should I go the same way, with eco-pea probably 1/5 cheaper?

Kowalski - thinks that evolution is nonsense, because otherwise a man would have two livers from drinking alcohol. Michalkiewicz - his whole life surrounded by Jewish conspiracies, a victim of long-term violence, he compares to the whore from the street. Cejrowski - a cat-fascist, creationist and liar, in his travel programs he often creates fairytales that match his vision of the world. Berkowicz - the greatest tryhard on the Polish right, his activity is repeating in real life shit-memes from the Internet. Sumliński - he writes fantastic books and promotes them as a journalistic investigation. Warzecha - a typical right-wing barker, believes that cycling and running are a leftist invention threatening European civilization Kikuu or whatever it is - a megalomaniac, augmented mental gimbus  Are not you ashamed?  inb4 suggesting that my idols are Szumlewicz.  #bekazprawakow #neuropa # 4konserwy #korwin #maxkolonko #michalkiewicz #polityka show whole source: canned food xd.jpg   +: wanghoi, Duze_piwo +176 others  ",2018-10-23 10:03:46,Clefairy,178,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_nDQAfIKPWFNJCn320Dwh90GK3Kal8Cet,w400.jpg""/>"

Uneven readings of smogometers - official claim that smog barely over 100% of the norm, but it was at 3 am (have 2 hours of slip) and airly claims that it is definitely closer to 150% (but airly has problems with distinguishing smog from the fog).

115,"               Coal is number when it comes to sources of air pollution in China. China receives about 70 percent of the total energy from carbon with high sulfur content. About six million tons of coal are burned daily to power factories, heat homes and cook meals. The constantly growing number of cars, heavy traffic and low-quality petrol have caused cars to contribute heavily to the problem of air pollution in Chinese cities.

135,"               In February 2013, Deutsche Bank published a report saying that China's current economic policy would lead to a huge increase in coal consumption and car sales in the next decade. Analysts said China's air pollution would reach such a level that it would become unbearable in the long run. They called China to drastic changes in politics and ""the government's strong will to overcome the business lobby."" The report estimates that the number of passenger cars in China is on track to reach 400 million by 2030 from 90 million today. It is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions in China will grow to at least 2030. It is highly likely that China will not comply with the declarations made under the Paris Agreement.  In China, the pattern of carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels in 2010-2015 amounted to 2,300 million tonnes, which is almost as much as India emitted in 2015. The total CO2 emission in China in 2015 amounted to 10,660 million tons (about twice as much as the US).

147,"               According to research, acid rain falls regularly on over 1/3 of mainland China. The problem is so serious that in some places every rainy day is a day of acid rain, and limestone buildings dissolve under its influence. Guangdong-Guangxi-Guizhou-Sichuan area south of Yangtze is the largest single area in the world affected by acid rain. A study carried out at the beginning of 2000 showed that one-third of the crops in the Chongqing region were damaged by acid rain. It may seem that this is only a Chinese problem, but not - sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants produced by the Chinese industry are falling in the form of acid rain in neighboring countries (including Japan, Korea and Taiwan), and even in North America.

180,"               In China, air pollution has led to an increase in premature births and births of infants with low body mass. Chinese smog is also responsible for growing cancer rates. Lung cancer is now the leading cause of death in China. Over the past five years, the number of deaths per cancer has increased by 18.5 percent to 34 per 100,000 inhabitants. Air pollution is also associated with other respiratory diseases. In some Chinese factories, the asthma index is 5 percent. It is estimated that 26 percent of all deaths in China are caused by respiratory diseases (compared to 2 percent in the US). The situation is so bad that even in rural areas, respiratory disease is the number one killer.  On the attached map you can see how the current state of air in Beijing looks like (1) compared to Warsaw (2), Madrid (3) and Fukuoki (4).

213,"               Mirki what a moment ago odjaniepawliło then I do not even ... A colleague with whom we have been brewing together for many years suddenly goes down to the exit from the loss and begins to pull me as well. Yesterday at about 20:00, after drinking a few cups of yerba mate, we decided to go watch these famous beta-ATMs and alpha males for a kebab booth. In fact, it is the second booth next to the introvertism, and we wanted to have a view from a wider perspective. After completing the carefully planned order and picking up the kebs, we went under the cover of the night in an unspecified direction. The operation of eating the meal was also successful, after which my colleague was escorted to the bus stop, from where (he took the bus, I from the shoe) we started to move back to our cellars.  2 minutes after midnight I received a message from him that he intends to delete the account on the excavation and in total even I was very happy (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °). Later, the worst came to me, that in any case he would continue to view my mother, just as anonymous. And here the biggest problem arises, so in connection with the situation and consequences of the deeds, THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM DAY.  Mirasy, I do not know what to do, I do not care, but I also like #feels because once everything was ok, and now I'm afraid that it can become an ordinary norm. We have just installed CS 1.6 and this is the situation here. I have the following questions:  0. Can this change be caused by smog / air pollution and do you think it can be reversed? Is it possible that he was too long outside the basement, but everything will be back to normal? 1. What to do if conventional methods (conversation, active silence) do not help, or prepare for a face 2 face conversation? 1. (variant) - remove it from friends on Steam, FB, etc., break the contact to not get sucked in? 2. (variant) - pretend that nothing is happening and that I do not know that it is browsing daily 3. Are there working codes on Delicious.pl? 5. How to deal with the loss of the co-cell leader? Trying to talk to him, can he leave with honor? 8. He wants to talk to me about books so that we can boast together. Is this already a manifestation of becoming this famous Chad? 13. If he prefers literature from sighing on pink belts from wypok.ru, is it more likely that he will prefer to meet with pink stripes in the real world and if there is contact between them (visual, touch, exchange of body fluids - sneezing / coughing, spawning) will I also be threatened with infection with normics by, for example, shaking hands with him?

360,"               #motorization #diesel #polithics #bereepost #smog #impl #lpg #after #pos #rzad #prawo #ecologia #uniaeuropejska #biurokracja #pieniaga I was looking for information about eco stickers that were to be stuck on cars in cities and came across interesting information. The winter season is fast approaching, so the smog return to the cities and that's what I found. In my opinion, this is a good scandal that officials do not cope with such a simple matter.  Instead of closed zones for cars, we have chaos. According to NIK, the government is fighting inefficiently with the issue https://moto.wp.pl/zamiast-stref-zamknietych-dla-samochodow-mamy-chaos-zdaniem-nik-u-rzad-nieskutecznie-walczy-z-emisja-6294509950162561a The Act on electromobility allows the creation of clean transport zones, which is restricted to the entry of vehicles other than: electric, powered by hydrogen or natural gas. In 2016, only 9,186 cars with such drives were registered in Poland. In practice, designating such a zone will mean closing the movement on it - with few exceptions. If LEZ were appointed in Warsaw, only 0.04 percent could enter it. registered in the capital of cars. In Katowice, this percentage would amount to 0.02 percent. and in Łódź, 0.01 percent. So the government has created a draconian law that local governments will probably not want to use. That is from 1 to 4 cars per 100  https://gazeo.pl/informacje/wiadomosci/Stare-diesle-do-lamusa,wiadomosc,8656.html Editor's comment  The proposed draft amendments to the regulations require many amendments and additions. The unregulated status of vehicles fueled with gaseous fuels (LPG, CNG, LNG) puts into question the rights not only of passenger cars, but also distribution vehicles, municipal vehicles (eg CNG refuse collection vehicles) and buses powered by low-emission gas fuels. Or maybe the model of Rome, from the operation of the Act, to exclude in an unambiguous and simple way: electric vehicles, LPG, CNG and LNG as those whose least negative impact on the environment is? The Italians, in the interest of clean air and monuments of the Eternal City, carried out extremely accurate studies of air and the impact of wheeled transport on the health of residents. Over 200 pages of the document became the basis, among others to allow cars powered by LPG and methane to enter the strict center without restrictions.  It's good to use good practices.  https://inzynieria.com/wpis-branzy/analizy_i_komentarze/8/48034,liczba-samochodow-na-lpg-rosnie-spada-liczba-stacji According to the data of the Polish Liquid Gas Organization, in Poland, the number of LPG-powered vehicles increased by 63 thousand. During this time, the number of stations on which you can refuel such cars, decreased by 30.  https://www.wyborkierowcow.pl/samochody-z-lpg-w-europie/ Most cars powered by autogas can be found in Turkey - there are over 4.2 million of them, which is 35% of all gas vehicles in Europe. In Poland, this number reaches almost 3 million (24%), while in Italy over 2.1 million (17.5%). Other countries no longer exceed the limit of half a million registered cars with LPG, and in four of them (Malta, Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg) number of cars on gas riding counted in hundreds of copies.  Does the government want to roll drivers who have cars powered by LPG and those who were going to start such an installation, which was associated with a considerable amount.  Maybe we should not judge the government and it is the only wine different climate, but winter driving on petrol is better than diesel, hybrid cars also assist with gasoline. Is it better to ride CNG on winter?  LPG is trouble in the winter.

Oslo - the capital of Norway will be the capital without cars in the center next year, and the capital of Finland - Helsinki wants to go even further and ban all private cars all over the city!

In Berlin, where there are eco-zones, there are more than 2 times less cars / passengers than in Warsaw. In Stockholm or London, special fees are charged automatically for entering the city, etc. etc. Only wild Poland, which has the most polluted air and the biggest traffic jams in Europe, does nothing ... I have a car myself, but I am willing to sell it or throw it on a garbage truck when such rights are introduced. Why do not I do it now? Because one person will not give much.

446,"               #krakow #raccontent If someone wants to get cancer, I recommend the following comment from Gazeta Krakowska:    This growth of the city must finally be stopped, because the city has been overpopulated for years (symptoms associated with it are traffic jams, smogs, epidemics - when eg flu rages in Krakow, in small Karpacz no one gets sick etc., alcohol, social margin, etc. ). The city should be closed, i.e. it should be forbidden to settle the immigrant population (non-local students should have a 3-month deadline to leave the city after completing academic education and the exceptions should be truly singular and regarding the greatest talents) and undertake a policy of discouraging large-scale (in overcrowded in the city the model should be a family with one child). Many children, let them move to those cities that are depopulating (Katowice, Łódź, etc.). It is necessary to demolish office buildings, because they - unfortunately - attract people from other cities and this work does not generate national income (it should be earning a lot in Silesia, because the miner's work is extremely hard and dangerous, that is a 12,000 miner per month and the office building has a minimum wage and no more zlotys). I would like not only to live up to the million-dollar Krakow, but also let Kraków never have become a millionth city in my history and that in my lifetime Łódź would be bigger than Krakow. Krakow should also have less population than Wrocław, considering the state before World War II, when Kraków had less than 250,000. population, while Wrocław (then outside of Poland) - over 600,000 population (that is, Wrocław was more or less as it is now). Annoying is the view of these pushing mothers with prams (literally every step), entering the belts in front of city buses (as much as one would like to see 120 km / h at the sight of a trolley ...). Do not build flats and lead the newcomers to OPEN TO KRAKÓW. let other cities taste overpopulation. In truth, Nowa Huta could become a separate city and really deserve it. show the whole   +: lubie-cheesenik, ixkava +6 others  ",2018-09-27 22:35:36,N.....s,8,

448,"               I am so surprised that they complain about smog everywhere, and eg in Gdansk, there are many blocks, mainly those a little older, such as the old chelmie where central heating is connected everywhere, and in older blocks it is literally nearby. It would not have been better to pull up the switchboard to these blocks and let the people connect themselves, always better than smoking in the ovens with coal. #gdansk #smog show the whole   +: lubie-cheesecake, Cronox  ",2018-09-26 14:20:27,LinQ,2,

You had to embrace, three hungry furs to feed, clean the litter ... and so I only started at 6:30.  Sunrise missed, but nothing lost - and so were the clouds. In addition, nice and crisp - less than 10 ° C, a light breeze that apparently managed to smash the smog (I expected it would be bad after this drop in temperature).  I rested yesterday, so it went pretty well and quickly started to gain momentum. Initially, I planned to do 14 km, then due to the mud I changed the route and the plan was 16.5 km, but when I approached the crossroads I decided to fly to 19, and then I found that after 5 minutes no property and I turned on the tongue that already gave craved two nozzles ᕙ (⇀‸↼ "") ᕗ  And everything at a rate of 4: 50 / km.
