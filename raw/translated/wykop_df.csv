I'll start with the fact that I'm still working on #freelance but after 7 years I wanted more stability even at the expense of less cash;) For this purpose, I gave an ad where he would go and waited for calls: D  First phone call. A nice man offers me a job - banners for PLN 8 for social media. He said that I had a cool portfolio :) After deducting all the costs associated with DG after a month, I would have to pay PLN 500.  A company that sells supplements - that is, stretching old grandmothers and Grażyna to miracle cures for smog and varicose veins. The money above the average (""we do not feel such money on us"") but the scope of duties from kindergarten to opole. With the owner of the company at the end we talked about lego technics and in total they saw me so much. Young wolves. Now they are changing the office to bigger ones.  Bank - for this conversation I got ready like a rat to open a channel. I was recruited by a nice lady recruiter and a boy from the graphic department. Because I knew the answers to all the questions because my sister works in Medicover HR went smoothly. The money is pretty cool but strong-corpo. And you have to work 30 minutes longer. I was only surprised if I would like to work for them. Very nice conversation - but they did not have coffee :(  Small Agency - nice agency, cool projects but unfortunately the owner ""sincerely regrets"" because I'm out of reach. Rather, I would not like to earn as much as Junior Graphic Designer in 2011. I do not just need work for my money.  Small Agency 2 - it was really strange and long conversation, the owner boasted that the company is so family that sometimes I work until 4 am. I was supposed to do a test task, but I got a different offer and gave it myself. They have a mutisport - it's an important and family atmosphere. She even asked if I could get involved. And I got a compliment that I look young: D  Small Agency 3 - here the hajże disagree even though customers have quite cool. Honestly, if I would apply to Lidl, I would like the bonuses similarly.  Big Agency - oh, there were stairs here. Professional questions, not any talk about weather and littering. I must admit that I even sweated a little but maybe because I drank a lot of coffee before and during the meeting. They have to think and let me know.

This time we did not fail in health / organization (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  I wrote that I'm going to sleep last weekend. Yesterday did not work out ... by cats (let you, @tomekkp - did you have to be right?) And I slept less than 6 hours. But today ... today ... 7h51m !!! I almost got to these mythical 8 hours! (づ • ﹏ •) づ  It's less about sleeping. I got up at 7:30 somehow, got together with everything, we ate breakfast - Sunday and lazy, but (at least I) a bit more delicate than usual. Then at 10 I took a friend to the center, who stayed with us and was therefore ready to fight (͡º ͜ʖ͡º)  I parked in Old Kleparz and decided that it was worth warming up - that's why I did not wait for it, I jogged at a slower pace (5:52 min / km) 3 km with a hook to Błonia. There I met an old friend who I talked to a bit - and then I went to the start, where I had the pleasure of meeting personally @baang (.◕‿‿◕.) There is nothing like meeting young, young (girl, now I saw your age category (ʘ‿ʘ)) and beautiful Mirabelka!  I did not know where to set myself - in the end I decided that with my current, medium form, the position at the end of sector 1:39 would be just like that. The balloons barely showed me in the distance. Divine weather, heat and some sun (sometimes too much) and a nice breeze that smudged elegantly.  Boom! Start! And no, the boom was not there, the countdown also some in two installments, but in the end the music turned into a battle-warming - although not my beloved AC / DC starting Thunderstruck, at which I get such energy that I am ready to accelerate until the asphalt rupture (ò‿⫑⫑ó)  When we finally set off, we managed to get some speed away - somehow people around were sluggish and I started to overtake. Already before the second kilometer I caught up with balloons ... and of course, as usual, I let myself be carried away by emotions and accelerated. ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ Of course, at the end I regret it, but what I rushed to mine.  The first five were crazy with madness in the eyes and with an average of 4:28 min / km. Then I slightly lowered my tone, but the voices in my head told me ""or maybe a record dycha?"" and of course I rushed on. ana Król Jadwiga amused me by the least hit LED advertising in the world, advertising services ... obesity treatment clinic (✌ ゚ ∀ ゚) ☞  Unfortunately, the 45-minute tense was not successful, 5 misery seconds ͠ (͠ ° ෴ °) were missing ノ which I might not have lost, if not for many of them just before that nozzle ... Well, maybe another time?  Then it was halfway and went quite well cool, although in the vicinity of Wawel and Plant a little bit of a pace sat down - but after leaving the boulevards I saw that the balloons catch up with me and I accelerated again.  Unfortunately, they finally caught up with me, and at the 19th kilometer I started to lag behind. I threw all the strength into the oven, but still it was 100-150m away to the finish line. Estimation - at the end just before the finishing line they stopped and were warming up to fight! (ʘ‿ʘ) Thanks boys!  Semi-conscious, I came to the finish line. The result 1:38 with a small hook ... Who knows, maybe if I would run nicely with pacemakers and escape for 2 kilometers before the finish line it would be a life-time? Well, what can I advise that stupid ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ But it turned out better than in October!  Super gear handling, great water, lying on Błonia great, delicious żurek - great! It was great, I played wonderfully and sensationally felt - thank the organizers and congratulations to all contributors!

66,"               Tl: dr. Give me an etymology here about how to remove dust from my own experience.  Is the insertion of one or more (or, as it would be good for rooms in the apartment) cleaners, humidifiers or something else, to eliminate or minimize (if so by what percentage) the formation of dust? I live in Silesia, in my apartment I am very pissed off. Once, as part of the tests, I cleaned one room and then did not enter it for 2 weeks, it looked like it was cleaned up all the time. Being in it is enough for a few days to form a layer of dust. I am also referring to the deposition of dust in hard to reach places, I would like to minimize this. For example, for a few months in such places where it is not very easy to clean, a really solid layer is created. Has anyone succeeded? What to use? Tag #slask, but I'm happy to find out how you got there with dust, for example, by the sea, it probably does not depend on the climate what not? Only from the dryness of the air in the room, but maybe geographic location also changes something. #kurz #smog #oczyszczaczewowa #nawilzacztrzowa # apartment #remontujzwykopem #sprzatanie #aranzacjawnetrz #mirabelkopomusz show whole   +: Sark, MicroPepe +1 different  ",2019-03-20 07:35:33,caribbean,3,

93,"               Studies show that up to 50-60 percent of air pollution in South Korea comes from China. The problem is also partly due to Korean investments in Chinese enterprises, which contributed to the increase in emissions in China.  The situation is so serious that the Korean foreigners filed a class lawsuit against the governments of South Korea and China, accusing them of a frivolous approach to the problem and lack of steps to improve the current situation. South Korea has the worst air air from all developed countries (OECD) so it should not surprise this lack of satisfaction.  Transgenic air pollution is currently a problem not only for the Korean Peninsula, but for the whole of East Asia and South East Asia.

114,"               I honestly admire people who are able to live in Poland in an unrivaled way and make their future seriously connected with it:  - Currently, the poverty line in a big city is about 9-10k on hand, in case you do not have your own home for yourself. Everything below is simply a vegetation aimed at extending your life functions to the future. In fact, only a small part of Poles earn so much and it costs them many years of effort and education.  - Smashed environment and smog. Because of the shitty air quality, big cities are simply not viable, especially in winter. Only for this reason you get a punishment in the form of an average life shorter by 2-3 years.  - Hopeless quality of healthcare, the smallest number of doctors per capita across the EU. Currently, the average age of a Polish surgeon is about 56 years, and nurses - 52. 1/3 of medical students in the final years of their studies are already sure that after graduation he will emigrate to the West. And every year will only get worse.  - Poor quality of judicial services. I have encountered situations many times when people were afraid to enter into an interest not because of adequate legal protection and lack of any private trust. Chatty type:    Anon, we do not go into it. This guy looks badly from the eyes, then what? Are you going to think about some stupid 50,000 for 6 years, spending more on lawyers than you can get back?  They are on the agenda. Absolutely no one in Poland believes in law and courts here. Because of this, the mass of economic relations is based mainly on private trust, as in some Russia or Ukraine.  - Poor quality of food. Most of the goods sold on the Polish market, from Cola through cigarettes to plain bread are worse than elsewhere. This issue is being raised now, but it will take many years before the problem disappears. If you look closely, many Poles have unnaturally swollen faces and stomachs (fluid retention in the body).

116,"  People say that #wroclaw is so cool.  I spent all my life in him and I'm alive, but that's because I'm set Students from small towns, villages and other forgotten Polish cities come here and think that life here will be easy ...  Where is it!  Just look at this forecast:  You get to Wroclaw and get a gownoprace for PLN 2,500 net. You have 22 years, you rent a room for 1000 zlotys. You must eat something, sometimes drink, go out into the city, buy cosmetics, clothes ...  PLN 2,500 - salary 1000 zl - room (without an attendant, to live like a man) PLN 600 - food (at PLN 20 per day) 100zl - cosmetics / household chemistry PLN 100 - some fatalaszek 200zl - wyjscie do mieście na piwo / pizze / gyros PLN 80 - a urbancard ticket for a month of public transport 50zl - internet / telephone  The sum - PLN 2,500 minus PLN 2130 per month of modest life. You are 370 zlotys left  And what, it is worth a push here, if such pennies can be saved? The costs of living, which I gave to the meeting, so do not think that you'll go crazy like krols (200 zlotys for partying !!!) Cat would laugh, since the beer in the bar costs an average of 12 zlotys ...)  The pressure in this city is big, there are dozens of new office buildings here, smudges of new carts, people spend 800 zl for leather shoes or 2000 zlotys for Fjallraven park ...  Attention! If you are introverts, you like nature, peace and quiet, do not come here. After summing up the costs, it will be similar to you, or even better in your town. In Wroclaw, there is chaos, traffic jams, smog, a lot of events, people are crazy and business pressure is doing their job, but you must have eggs and you want to rub yourself so much ...

117,"               #pis #heheszki #policy  They built the airport, dug up Mieli Wislana, build the atomic ...  This power opens the eyes of unbelievers. Millions of electric amphibians are defeating a freshly dug-out towering on the way from the Radom port of the navy, transporting soldiers killed to the Polish colonist's sanctuary in Gdynia. It turns out that the 2 km cross-cut is still too small because the traffic on this section is much bigger than anyone expected. The Port of Elblag became the second post-port in Europe after Amsterdam and the goods produced in Poland flood China and Africa. The government is already planning the next stage of work, that is broadening the channel for the next 2 kilometers, although in the lobby it already roars with gossip. A gentleman from Suski, a Siberian speclalist, guessed that the government was planning to completely eradicate the spits and put all the sand on the Russian side, blocking access to the Russian ports in the Kalingrad Oblast. But it is known that such projects are not done in one day and sometimes you have to dig for a longer time. The President has already announced his readiness and as soon as he finds a scoop in the litter box, he will come back to the robot and this time he will go smoothly. Temporarily, the problem with the capacity of the 'Good Change' strait was solved thanks to drones from the motherland army. Thousands of well-trained soldiers from the WOT daily maneuver the drones carrying containers straight from the new central airport to container ships of the navy. What is unknown in these containers - this is the strictest secret. Transport is protected from land, sea and air. The gesture of fog and smog makes it impossible for random people to see what secrets are hidden by these containers. But unofficially, we found that the containers contain carbon or black gold. It turned out that this is our export hit and we send it to Russia. In exchange, the Russians send us slonine and shafts and radioactive waste. These three components will be used for energy production in a new reactor built near Toruń and completely financed from the contributions of the faithful. Thanks to the new technology developed at the Scientific Institute The Immaculate Saint of the Holy Father and Savior One managed to extract the bacon ingredients from the slon, which in the cover of the walnut allows to recover high-grade uranium from radioactive waste. The construction of the reactor is already ongoing, faithful slabs, but you can see that this investment will absorb more than assumed. Fortunately, in this sacred work, they decided to help generously shipyard workers from Gdanska. Poland stood on its feet and the song about her power is already spread all over the world. Presidents, prime ministers, kings, sheikhs come from all over the world to hand over the chairman of the savior of nations and to revive the torunski ...  source show the whole   +: lubie-cheesecake, janwit82 +5 others  ",2019-03-04 17:04:00,loook,7,

I knew that we had to turn up the pace so that the full stomach would not win - after the first kilometer it was good, and each next gave another several-dozen seconds of profit. Instead of going for a standard 12km route, I decided that I would catch a little bit of the nearby villages and stretch the party to 14km. I appreciated the power of the wind - a lot furiously, so strongly that every moment I fought with an intense wmordewind more than with the ascents. Despite this, I kept breaking the seconds and when it came to the return run, the wind was favorable and I lost much less than I expected. Along the way, I added a tongue extending to 15 km, and for the last kilometer I switched on all the afterburners, which resulted in a 4:22 min / km (ʘ‿ʘ) rate and quite a good 4:50 min / km (͡ ‿ ͡)  The run was pleasant and intense, I earned honestly for every second I missed.

There are no atheists, which means that it is a society with principles and a certain order of life. I would like to go there to change my life and have a goal to fight for it. In the Islamic State there is a lot of sun - the sun's rays from behind the window awake you stroking your face, you wake up feeling the fresh air and the desert smell of hot sand calling for Jihad in Europe. Completely different than in Poland - the holes in the roads, smog, Korwin, Kaczyński, Kukizy and syria, ground stinking under the liquor, I have nothing to fight for, because this ""country"" is ruined ... ISIS is only life: A rich Muslim culture, a range of flavors and beautiful prayers. Instead of Biedronka, there are stalls that fresh oriental food and spices tempt with its intense fragrance. The idea of ​​purity confessed in Islam has guided me from a small age. Poland tfu stinks with pork chops and sauerkraut. Half of the people are farmers and truckers who do not wash and either get dressed in shit or give away to shit. I would like to stain the Polish streets with the blood of unfaithful Poles from the age of 11, when the attack in Paris in 2015 happened.

160,"               #smog #kiciochpyta #przedszkole #dzieci  Mirki, I have a mission: I need an air humidifier that will handle the kindergarten room (around 40m2) and 25 children at a fair cost. I read about devices and humidification technologies, and everyone says something different, and the manufacturers are trying to figure out the reasons why their solution is the best.  Do you have any idea how to bite it? The room is mega dry, and in the winter the airing is limited to a minimum (because in the field crap - the center of the city). Maybe 2 smaller humidifiers? We do not have a quota limit - parents are throwing up on it, so I just want to propose something. I would like to add that the kindergarten is a purifier (handed over with great pomp through the province or someone there), but ... there is ONE COURSE. For the entire kindergarten, where there are 12 rooms and probably 400 children. Well ... a bit of a mockery. Ultimately, we also want to put in the ""own"" room, but this is probably a topic to move in the summer (out of season), when their prices will fall, so now we focus mainly on the humidifier.

For many years, neglected, if any, unrecorded, polluted and destroyed in large part by mining damage. The development is taking place too slowly and in small stages, according to the Polish principle ""somehow it will be"". The authorities stick a patch here and there to the oozing wound. They have been building the N-S route for 10 years and hope that there will be an economic miracle and maybe someone will build a gigantic building on Chebziu ""Radius"" which sounds absurd in itself. Poor urban communication, poor living conditions, many contaminated by the pathology of the settlements, smog such that it can be used to spread bread and social problems. Continuous lack of ideas for municipal construction and support for young families that could increase the population of the city. There are so many ""holes"" in this picture of Ruda Śląska that we may be witnessing the beginning of the slow decline of the city, which may become the second Bytom or Wałbrzych.

In total, nothing changed, because I dressed the same way at -1 and at -10 (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) Cloudless sky, windless sky. Smog like hell - 200 to 250% of the norm. It was only when, after the run, I took off my mask and felt like a smokehouse (ʘʖ̯ʘ), how do I look at it - the mask makes a medal.  With a heavy bebzol I went to conquer 12 km of the route, prepared for the pogrom. At the beginning it went badly, but I did my best to lose as much as possible on the road and, surprisingly, I managed to close the entire route 5:06 min / km ᕙ (⇀‸↼ "") ᕗ  Venus and Jupiter were beautifully shining, unfortunately Saturn and I could not see the devil ... Although this is nothing compared to last Friday when Venus and Jupiter were just above the beautiful sickle of the moon ... (.◕‿‿◕.)  Tomorrow, I'm still running in the morning, but on Saturday the skis are already riding - maybe even once this season I'm riding myself ...

280,"               I have a question for people who know the construction law. Single-family housing. A neighbor bought an old house from the 70's (cube) and changed the location of the boiler room. For this reason, the chimney is in a different place than it should be. At the street all the houses are the same and all have a chimney in the line - just no neighbor. Plots are small so the distances between houses are also small (min resulting from the regulations).  His current chimney is very close to my ventilation inlets, which results in the fact that at home I can smell the smell of the neighbor's chimney.  Can the neighbor change the location of the boiler room and thereby build a new chimney on the ventilation chimney line?  #smog #building show the whole   +: czv1  ",2019-02-07 10:14:49,Seduire,1,

290,"               I have to agree with one thing about Tehran. An unpleasant city, about which many people write about things in different places. There is little to watch what is typically Persian. And omnipresent smog. In the morning he was gone and the mountains presented a nice view, but then it began. The piston, the drivers drive as they want and if they stop, it's only on the few lights, so you have to maneuver very skilfully between cars and scooters. Despite this, feel the climate of Iran, but the contemporary, which is, according to my 'guide' (a man who offered to show Tehran directly, a moment ago) a 14 million metropolis, so a bit dingy. Tehran will have enough for one day. Visiting all museums for two. Well, hooks. A gentleman named Bahram accompanied me for several hours, guided me, showed me some interesting places and told various things, being interesting to Poland as well. English teacher, so we could get along without a problem. Of course, I got a few euros for the service because I did not expect to do it for free. But we drank good coffee, kebab with their traditional bread, we ate, and you can see that Mr. Bahram showed off with a guideline because he was very familiar. But other people also accosted. I do not count how many times there were 'salam' on the street, 'how are you', 'welcome to Iran' from people of all ages. The first person who accosted me, such a typical Iranian Janusz, when I told him where I was from immediately said 'Poland good volleyball'. Others asked if I liked it, when I flew in, for how long, etc. Smiles everywhere. Excitable people. One of me tried to cheat at the Golestan Palace because he thought I would not ask for 200,000 rials of the rest. The entry cost 300,000 and I gave 500000. @seledinowa_panienka #iran #podroze #podrozujzwykopem show whole source: IMG_20190206_153555.jpg   +: TadzioNorek, kotbehemoth +20 others  ",2019-02-06 16:57:31,Fevx,22,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_IO4RGsmid7xfxB30BU7nKVlTJX2vUSMv,w400.jpg""/>"

294,"               What is the meaning of free communication? Smog in Poland is not the fault of cars, but the burning of coal in houses, which should be hooked as fast as possible to heat plants. I found a map that shows the concentration of NO2 in the air (nitrogen dioxide), nitrogen oxides formed as a result of fuel combustion, mainly from communication sources (cars, ships, heavy machinery, etc.). The map in the upper corner illustrates air pollution caused by smoking, among others coal. In contrast to Western Europe in Poland, the problem of air pollution by car exhausts does not really exist. Why, then, introduce free communication? Why are road entry bans introduced for cars with internal combustion engines? It is necessary to connect houses to the heating plant as soon as possible and eliminate low emissions (emission of dust and harmful gases coming from local coal-fired boilers and domestic heating furnaces). #smog #communicationandthecommunicationwebsite show the whole source: smog.jpg   +: Bakanany, 6REY1MISTERIO9 +115 others  ",2019-02-06 08:59:12,Crea,117,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_oS6FmL2WO61sgs4jcUEnZHfs0NcRS42m,w400.jpg""/>"

Lightly belated, because I wanted to run out 5 but I overslept and I found myself 10 minutes later in front of the house - and that I had a clearly set time target, instead of 14 km I flew for 12. I like it very much when the forecasts are so perfect - especially when they are in my way (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) The temperature dropped, as expected, to -1 ° C, in the morning the rain gave way to light snowfall and the wind was raging enough that he smashed the whole smog into three devils (ʘ‿ʘ)  I ran just like yesterday - that is, first from the hill and only later flattening out, and finally arduous climb. Cool conditions - at times the snow creaked underfoot, sometimes (fortunately, rarely) it was slippery, and thanks to the lead I managed to avoid a few large puddles, after which the course would not be so nice. It seemed that it would go weak - the beginning was bad, and the next kilometers flat did not promise a revelation while inexorably the first runs were approaching. To my surprise, however, it turned out that I was able to mobilize and the ""grain-to-grain"" method meant that after buying bread and milk, before the last run, I had over a minute of supply. Like a camel, I was a bit of a bit slower looking like a camel, but I managed to defend an average of 4:57 min / km ᕙ (⇀‸↼ "") ᕗ  Have a nice Monday (or rather its rest)!  show spoiler #track #guidingtop #guiding #enronczlapie #ruszkrakow  show the whole source: embed.jpg   +: Akuku69, esuwir +12 others  ",2019-02-04 16:20:42,enron,14,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_bArhHbBUoAmv35WDYvAyNAha1xIPxpcc,w400.jpg""/>"

314,"               The program of the new Biedronia party: ""Spring"" has been published.  I will translate to you:  - closing all coal mines until 2035,  show spoiler or liquidation of the Polish mining industry and sell it for pennies to foreign countries.  - concordat renegotiation, liquidation of the church fund and ""such"" taxation,  show spoiler or communist liquidation of the Catholic religion, because this is contrary to the communist ideals.  - the right to abortion on demand up to the 12th week of pregnancy,  show spoiler ok, this one looks like something that PiS broke down, but probably will not return to the previous balanced abortion law, but will go to the opposite extreme.  - raising the minimum wage,  show a spoiler, but I understand that taxes will not reduce employers' taxes, so we will face a rise in unemployment and deterioration in the labor market, as well as the bankruptcy of subsequent Polish small businesses. Well, unless they found inflation and persuade stupid boys that they earn more.  - 500 Plus changes to include the first child and parents raising their children independently  show a spoiler or shit in the pump, because 500 plus has already caused Poles to be deprived, and children began to be born less. If, however, they kept their word, prices would go even higher.  - creation of a justice and reconciliation commission that will help settle ""those who break the constitution"".  show spoiler Mean second constitutional court? For what?!   After all, it's a party of bis. (-‸ლ)  And besides:  As part of the program, he declared the introduction of a 30-day limit for waiting for a specialist doctor. ""After this time everyone will be able to choose a place of treatment in the private sector, for which the NFZ will pay""  show spoiler That is rozpieprzanie private medical sector and increase in taxes, because now you will need to not only pay for private office, but also officials, and grandparents who go to the doctor to talk.   Biedroń also announced the fight against smog, which - as he pointed out - is the reason for numerous deaths in Poland. ""I declare that by 2035 we will close all coal mines and we will have the cleanest air in our part of Europe - finally"" - he stressed.  show spoiler Can anyone tell this ... very foolish man that smog does not come from coal mining, but by burning in furnaces garbage and low quality coal imported from Russia?   The leader of the new party, speaking about animal rights, assessed that successive governments in this matter ""hide their heads in the sand"". ""Therefore, we will create an independent office of the Ombudsman for Nature, we will abolish fur farms, we will forbid the use of animals in circuses, we will stop the mindless felling of trees that destroys our centuries-old heritage""! Eliminate another part of the economy, add new officials and increase taxes even more. That there would be nothing!  ""Poland is a woman, her suffering is our suffering"". ""We will break the women's hell and, in the end, we will guarantee women the right to safely terminate their pregnancy on demand until the 12th week,"" he said.  show spoiler I may not know, but do not embryos experience a greater hell during abortion than a loose mother who does not want to take responsibility? I understand when the fetus is sick, the mother's life is at risk, or the father was a rapist, but promoting the removal of each pregnancy is beyond the limits of morality.     He also declared that every woman - regardless of whether she is a resident of a large city or small village - had access to safe medical care.  show spoiler Chwila, he has not promised free care to every citizen before? How can gender chauvinism (sexism) be included in the program ?! And will everyone pay money?   ""We will focus on the family and its safety, which is why we will introduce reliable sexual education, guarantee anesthesia during delivery and full in vitro financing"".  show spoiler I'm afraid to ask what will happen in this curriculum.   According to him, ""we've had a really hard choice for the last dozen or so years."" ""On the one hand, we were given a policy of economic charts and indicators (...) Women's and minority rights had to wait because there were always more important things to do, millions of people, millions of us stayed behind, and power told us"" change your job, take credit, go abroad ""- said Biedroń.  show spoiler Economics? Economy? And what is it for whom? The economics of the people will not feed, but respect each other by discriminating against certain social groups and privileging others, and at the end they can tax everyone as much as they can and depend on the official's will.   ""we got a freak of democracy, breaking the constitution, receiving women's rights, a propaganda tube instead of public media with a state administration, instead of a professional civil service, with Rydzyk on the throne, instead of a secular state.""  show spoiler. Judge for yourself. For me, this is an inept populist babble that only the extreme left can get.   ""You can talk to residents not only before the election, you can make the officials' salaries public, you can give up the presidential limousine, you can put on clean air and have the best air in the country. You can not let the circus with animals, you can effectively cooperate with the EU and to obtain EU funds, you can introduce in vitro and reliable sexual education, you can separate the state from the church ""- said Biedron.  show spoiler Well, let's just ask for what? I can already see the limos dropping out. Wait, what did he say? ""You can put on clean air and have the best air in the country."" What is he? I want to take care of the air in only one city?     According to Biedronia, the word ""homeland does not have to rhyme only with blood and scar"". ""That our homeland would not be a ballast, which must be thrown, but wings that can give our dreams."" Let's finally start adding wings, let's stop them in the end. Let patriotism be responsible for all who feel Polish and Polish, ""he said. .  show spoiler If the communist refers to patriotism, then know that populism has entered him strongly.   In addition, Biedron will present a bill abolishing the National Media Council, a draft amendment to the Act on the National Broadcasting Council, and a draft amendment to the Act on the performance of a deputy's and senator's mandate, increasing the legal responsibility of politicians for spoken words.  I did not exchange everything, read the rest for yourself. Personally, I do not recommend it very much and I do not divine successes. PO and Modern, entering the political scene, at least sought and first made an environmental interview to check what the Poles expect. The fact that their programs had nothing to do with their actual political doctrine, but at least their programs were not the ideological ejaculation of a crazy old man who longs for old times.

If I would like to, I can go outside every day and night and make a few kilometers run without harm to my health and without coughing black after stopping. Such an obvious thing, but not really. And certainly not in Poland, where I lived in the city ~ 200k, I preferred not to open the window in the winter evening, and when passing through the village during the day I got dizzy.

319,"               Has anyone recently taken the subject of air purifiers including DYI options? I read a little about Xiaomi Purifier 2S. From what people write, you can not rely on its automation, because standards are set according to China and reduce sales too early. On the other hand, in the EU version, apparently, you can not even set the automation using the pollution sensor to manually set at what threshold you want to activate the Favorite mode. So I thought about such a strategy, for example, an hour before coming home to turn him on to the max and then let him quietly walk in the low-efficiency mode. Possibly the same action one hour before going to sleep in the bedroom. I am thinking about buying this filter also for future pollination and allergen removal, but probably I would have to change the HEPA filter right away. Well, I also found a few descriptions of how to make such an air filter, either using Xiaomi filters and a fan that would draw air as well as standard fans and the rectangular HEPA filters applied to them. Somebody went in this direction? If someone has a Xiaomi filter, what ""cleaning strategies"" do you use? Do you also limit the amount of air entering through the ventilation grilles? Is it possible to manually set several favorite speeds and attach them at selected times so that they do not disturb? Did anyone with allergies to mites, grass and trees use HEPA and EPA filters at home in the season and saw differences? #xiaomi #smog #superair #allergy #dyi #zakupyzchin # question #purifier show whole   +: W33D420  ",2019-02-03 19:37:50,trv61866,1,

Almost 7 hours of sleep ...  I accepted the fact that I will not run today - record early, because at 10:00 I had to start a great family breakfast and then it was time to gather for a trip ... However, it turned out that, however, it will be possible to save less than an hour - I quit to my wife that I'm flying and I jumped on a short, eight-kilometer route. Smog was already thinning - it was above 100% of the norm, but I saw that there is a downward trend, it starts to blow strongly, and besides, I absolutely did not want to run in the mask. Warm, 9 ° C - so of course, short pants and t-shirt. I was expecting it to be poor - after a rather hearty breakfast it is rather hard to run ... However, after the first kilometer it turned out that it is not that bad at all. I turned up the screw and it turned out that the further the better - at every kilometer I stopped a few dozen and a few seconds against the standard tempo of 5: 00 / km ᕙ (⇀‸↼ "") ᕗ  Of course, I was waiting back uphill, but as it turned out - the right motivation does the miracles (ʘ‿ʘ) I promised to come back before noon and I was so upright that despite the hills I kept up the pace and got ahead of time keeping the average rate of 4:45 min / km (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  I know the distance of a tyciutka, but I am in shock that after breakfast managed to get such a result ...

Is it 1% to save a man from a catastrophe? Do not deny that you have to do something because the smog and general pollution of the environment is processed, but with this hype on the co2 probably lately strongly exaggerating because the plans are not keeping the average temperature only as little as possible and pouypało ideas on fees / taxes / tributes and head it hurts.

Could your actress start a wave of compensation cases from the Treasury?  It should be noted that in recent times even the authorities of Wroclaw have stopped people putting putty that it is good - once new information on air quality at MPK stops showed that the state is ""GOOD"" and SkyTower could not be seen from 300 meters.  I do not know about you Mireczki and Mirabelki but I personally saw the inscription for the first time ""Air quality: CRITICAL"" last week. (pic rel if you can see something in this pixel).  Of course there is a hate on Mrs. Wolszczak, because she is making a storm for poisoned air when she smokes herself, etc. but this should not distract attention from the problem of smog in Poland.  #wroclaw #smog #polska #krasnalnienawci show the whole [see 20190122_210543-1.jpg]   +: IEatBread, Lowca_kotojeleni +2 others  ",2019-01-27 23:22:13,WildGooseberry,4,

400,"               With dedication to all those writing that smog arises from:    smoking shit   smoking garbage   smoking with charcoal smoking  Such talk makes me angry because it shows ignorance about the writer. People, coded that most of the shit you breathe does not come with smoking boots in the oven, but with the smoking technique of the allowed fuel. The best quality coal will be smoked if the smoker can not smoke in the oven! Ba, wood can also smoke and it's worse than coal.  This is confirmed by the results of the municipal police inspection:    Years are flying and the statistics of the Municipal Guards in this respect do not change. Ba, with the increase in the number of inspections and the media intensity of the campaign, the percentage of ""hits"" drops. Here is the report on the activities of the Municipal Police in Katowice for 2018: 4429 controls, of which 1000 using a drone,   150 waste incineration cases were found (yes, one hundred and fifty, here there was zero)   The entire 3.4% of the cumbersome excavation came from the boiler rooms, in which waste was also incinerated. This means that 96% of the tested boiler rooms are honest coal and wood - and (usually) nothing is done with it.

423,"               #anonimowemirkowyznania Ehhhh and I wrote this on anonymous because I got a bit of an official. Actually, I write this out of concern for my father because he will not write. Let's start this story: I get alimony from my father (pennies, but nevertheless) fact that I do not have to pay them for some time but I have to pay. Now he called sad that he must go to court for a waiver and ask me not to make him a problem. Of course I will not make problems, I say, but what happened to you are so sad, etc.  The father must directly from Penti he tightens the neck of the apartment got a raise of almost 350 zł 700 and where charges are drugs and food, etc.? Who is to blame, of course, and no respected pier * lona european union and their standards and actually fight with their fictional #smog. My father lives in a fairly small town, which is quickly expanding and lives in a historic tenement house.  Now, there was some restoration and exchange gas heating stoves paying another 60% no cool only after such a renovated standard goes up and the money that pays TBS will be downloaded in the form of rent unless they charged him from the subway and 1.50 and still have something added. My father had a small crib where he collected aluminum, some washing machines or other things. Even this had to quit paying for this month 130-150zł and of itself moonlighted as he has the work of doing it skillfully, even the people themselves could help sometimes.  Of course, everything is decided by the privately owned housing community, such as new-fashioned whistles that are nasty and nasty. My old man is about 60 years old probably in your places will soon come such a moment when you have parents in retirement, etc. What if your father will not be able to afford a few more raises and he will have a choice of bread or aaaaaa must eat because his job is physical work.  I'm curious what you write is there any solution to this situation in some way or the father showing bills, etc. may apply to the court oo his exclusion from the investment because he does not need to be happy. Is there any way for such people, like a spade, I give away to the left and right aaa, unfortunately, a few fathers would be really useful simply for living and not having a parasite etc. I deal with a sick mom paying premium taxes and other crap.

Pros of moving out: - more entertainment / concerts / restaurants, we like it very much and in Suwalki it is not - easy access to various types of activities (horse riding, shooting range, etc.) - better schools (future daughter) - living in a large city gives you great opportunities to develop a passion in your child, to which we as children had limited access - close in the mountains :) - it's easier to find jobs in my industry - the mentality of people in Suwalkach is very overwhelming - it's far from Suwalk  Disadvantages of moving out: - far from the family :( - it's hard for us to make new friends, here we have a few, but some friends, there will be no one and will not be able to meet someone - Suwalki have nice surroundings (greenery, forests, lakes), with which it's hard to leave - there are traffic jams in a big city, a long way is going from one end of the city to the other - not air, smog - high prices of real estate, both rental and purchase - and again, fuck, far from the family :(  As you can see the pluses are as much as minus ... on one side we choke on here and on the other we are afraid to leave everything and leave.  Edit: maybe someone from Krakow / Katowice will say how you live in these cities? Do you like them or will you run away?  #conversion #ehhhhhhhhhhhhh show the whole   +: xiaore, Rapepo +2 others  ",2019-01-24 20:08:28,elpoliko,4,

431,"               is there anyone who is more interested in #smog? Every now and then a chimney sweep comes to our company and sometimes I talk to him about the quality of coal, etc. From the word to the word went to the Krakow smog. He stated that once the layer of smog was much larger and was less of a problem than it is today (research has been conducted for several dozen years). The cause of today's problems is the layer of water vapor, which is a kind of blockage of these pollutants. In contrast, the source of water vapor are, among others, gas boilers that produce from 1cm3 of natural gas up to 1.5m3 of water vapor. I do not know how true it is, but I was interested in such a theory. Theoretically, there were a lot more solid furnaces, the exhaust fumes from cars were more harmful (I'm not talking about vehicles - corpses that smoke with oil).

Because from the point of view, it seems that all the stylish ones are only expensive and not necessarily effective.  So far, the best thing I found is - https://ecohealth.com.pl/ - PLN 29 for black with FFP3. I am just looking for something where an external institute has confirmed this FFP3.  Because I no longer know what is better - a mask with magic filters without even mentioning certification or a mask in which the manufacturer declares certification, but in total it may not meet these standards, because who will check it.
