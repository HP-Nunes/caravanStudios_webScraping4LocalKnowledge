43,"               I will vote even for the part of Riga Petru, if it finally introduces in this game a total ban on installing coal-fired ovens in new homes.  In the case of old houses, any renovation (raising, extension, etc.) requiring notification, also automatically requiring a change in the heating method.  If you can not afford gas, electricity, oil, you simply can not afford a house and live in a flat or grandma's room.  If you have gas and you do not join, it's an official order to install heating other than coal or some poor fuel ...  And do not go here with some X generation coal-fired boilers, because it's just the same shit in a different paper. The fact that something meets the Polish emission standard, it means that it is still something that is stomping everyone around.  I repeat, if you can not afford to heat the house according to the scenario of a civilized man, then stay where you are.  And such a fact for fans of coal, eco-peas, pellets and other poor fuels for Janusz. Gas is cheaper. It no longer writes about purity, aesthetics, and functionality, because the so-called black and gold fans, soot and ash do not matter.

45,"               Look what I came across on the website of the Jarocin commune. CLICK  quotation:    It is not the extremely harsh winter of the turn of 2012/2013 that inspired me to write this statement, but the deepest conviction that the theory of global warming and especially the statement about the decisive impact of human activity on climate change is another hucpa, lacking reliable scientific basis. Information has been disseminated to the public about data falsification by some scientific communities in order to make this dubious theory more credible. In turn, Russian scientists say that we are not at risk of global warming, on the contrary we should expect global cooling. We know that there have been periods of warming and cooling in the past of the Earth. The reasons for these changes have nothing to do with human activity. The inexorable fight that international levy has given the alleged global warming probably will have a devastating effect on the level of economic development of many countries, especially such as Poland, whose energy is based on fossil fuels. In connection with the adoption by Poland of the EU climate and energy package, as time passes, there will be a steady increase in energy prices, and with this increase in the level of prices of all other goods. The only hope that someone on the top of power will wake up and restore normality. Realizing that in this matter nothing at the lowest level of self-government can be done, at least in a symbolic way with my statement, I excluded the area of ​​the Jarocin commune from the area of ​​the rule of all-powerful foolishness.

What is the best way to pay? **   Paypal (you must have a PayPal account) or a USD currency card (bank or revolut.com/DiPocket) connected to PayPala (in case of problems there are 180 days to create a claim and recover money (especially important for more expensive packages)). When paying with a currency card attached to PayPala, you should also follow these steps: https: //www.wykop.pl/wpis/25914651/co-zrobic-aby-paypal-obciazyl-karte-walutowa-bez-p/   ** 2. Do you take parcel insurance? **   It's better to take for more expensive purchases.   ** 3. Which shipment to choose? **   For Banggood, the parcel reducing the chance for VAT is Priority Direct Mail (PDM) and European Direct Mail (EDM). For Gearbest Priority Line (is available for selected products in Chinese warehouse) - this type of shipment reduces the chances of VAT. Other types of parcels do not reduce the chances of VAT, but it is better to take a registered air mail (I think it is best to choose Belgium Registered, then Europe Registered, at the end of PostNL.) Than unregistered, which sometimes can go a long way (of course it can also be registered so long). If it's 60 days, and we still do not have packages, write to Gearbest.

57,"               Hi Mireczki. I do not want to write new ones or copy old elaborates. I will write only one thing, actually I will ask you. Where did the belief that smog comes from 1) smoking with ""shit"", garbage, waste, etc. 2) poor quality of coal?  If your neighbor kicks gray or black smoke, stinks, and bites his throat, he is more likely to use fuel than he smokes in the wrong way. The Municipal Guard once visited my parents, even though they smoked with legal coal.  Both factors mentioned above have an impact on air pollution, but not as great as they are attributed to. Even the best quality coal will smoke and fry if it burns unskilfully. Nay! Even wood that functions in the consciousness as a relatively clean fuel will be sour, because it has more gas fraction than coal (energy from wood burning in 70% consists of gas combustion, when in coal it is 30%). Only the coke does not smoke because it is carbonated gas. You buy the best coal on the market, and you'll light it from the bottom, you will smoke, according to the principle presented in the picture below.  Therefore, in the name of cleaner air, beyond the extermination of the habit of burning rubbish, Poles' customs of how to light up and teach them to fire from above should be changed.  I refer to my last entry on this subject: https://www.wykop.pl/wpis/36781443/mirki-scisnal-mroz-i-znowu-glosno-jest-na-temat-sm/ And to the site from which I downloaded knowledge on this topic: http://czysteogrzewanie.pl/ And here a brochure to print with instructions firing up from above for tossing the mugging neighbor: http://czysteogrzewanie.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/poradnik_v2_082018.pdf  PS. Such or similar brochures should be given by municipal guards after interventions, where no smoking was allowed by unauthorized material. Since they have arrived, it means that the delinquent is stinking and someone is bothering it, and if he uses the correct fuel, it means that he smokes it in a bad way and it should be educated.  #ekologia #zdrowie #polska #ogrzewanie #ciekawowki #zanieczyszczenieewowie # question #smog show the whole source: czystogrzewanie.pl   +: push3k-pro, T ...... r +8 others  ",2018-12-02 19:09:22,wilku88,10,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_vvl5VMCWhatEsMTUS4rf6kS6PX6DOeaK,w400.jpg""/>"

Yellow pungent smoke in an amount that you could feel like in Silent Hill. First phone call to SM - the application was accepted but ""we do not know if the patrol will arrive on time"". Well ok On the occasion of the house, the car drove up, we did not fail to ask what they smoke and if they can not see that they are licking the whole area. The Lord is like a fierce album, ""this is coal, it's coal, it's coal."" Then that ""this stove burns"". And so much from the conversation. We informed that SM was notified. As we were returning from the walk the stove was extinguished and nothing was flying from the chimney. I wonder why;)  The second situation was already a show of SM. The phone may be 30 minutes after the previous one, we were several kilometers away. The situation was even worse than before, we started to regret that we went for this walk because I was sick of the smell and blue headache. Feeling like it happened with your head in the smoke from the fire. We call on SM receives the same clown (P) and talks with blue (N)  N - good morning, I wanted to report littering P - Is this you again? N - yes, here and here the situation is the same, you can not breathe, biting yellow smoke all around. P - I will not accept the application because you exaggerate how it is smoke is normal N - are you hearing? It is normal how the smoke is yellow, heavy, that it envelops the whole area that barely visible and bites in the throat causing coughing? P - this is normal N - I assure you that this smoke is not normal and I will gladly document it with a video or photos and I will send you P - let me send you, I do not accept the application N - good, it makes no sense to talk to you, goodbye. Let it not surprise you then that they are laughing at you.  this is a battle with smog performed by the Municipal Police in Mysłowice.

I woke up quite lazily about 6 with a hook, but I found that I would wait until the sun went out and left just before 8 am.  The temperature is crazy, 4 ° C on the plus - I dig out the short clothes, then with the mask I started on something that I originally planned for 12-15 km (I mentioned that I did not really want?) - this time almost without leaving Krakow, because it was quite wet and I did not want to rub in the mud. I did not really exert myself to speed up - I rather used fugitives to make up for it and tried not to lose on flat and uphill ... just such a weekend pierdupdud. Flying through the detours, I managed to stretch the route to 19 km, and at the end I moved further into the estate to include these two dicons (ʘ‿ʘ)  The average came out not bad for a fairly loose run in the mask - 4:51 min / km. I ran with a parallel fired Runkeeper and garmin, and from time to time I controlled the discrepancies - and it was pretty cool, the difference of 40-60m on such a distance is as if it was not there.

Do you take parcel insurance? **   It's better to take for more expensive purchases.   ** 3. Which shipment to choose? **   For Banggood, the parcel reducing the chance for VAT is Priority Direct Mail (PDM) and European Direct Mail (EDM). For Gearbest Priority Line (is available for selected products in Chinese warehouse) - this type of shipment reduces the chances of VAT. Other types of parcels do not reduce the chances of VAT, but it is better to take a registered air mail (I think it is best to choose Belgium Registered, then Europe Registered, at the end of PostNL.)

182,"  smog is a leftist invention, a hipster fad on the Soros belt (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)    Two weeks before the start of the world climate summit, the Polish government member made a spectacular disgrace. Krzysztof Tchórzewski's ministry has issued a position in which he assures that for the fight against air pollution he intends to lead through the development of agriculture, forestry and fertile soils.    What exactly does the post dated November 13 contain? It is a declaration of struggle to improve air quality and stop negative climate change while defending coal like independence. The resort is convinced that the energy security of Poland depends on the black metal.    Poland, according to Tchórzewski and his people, is to keep the energy mix in which 80 percent. the energy produced comes from coal. Is it possible to talk about the fight against climate change at all by cultivating such an archaic model? Experts agree that no. The minister, however, knows his own. In his opinion, it is enough to support ""absorption of greenhouse gases by agricultural soils, forests, forests and peat bogs"". The ministry intends to put additional renewable energy and zero-emission industry into this, but it does not leave any illusions that a departure from coal is planned at all. The energy ministry believes that the power sector should be changed ""evolutionary"". In other words - there is no reason to rush, even though Poland currently has the most polluted air in Europe.  https://strajk.eu/kompromitacja-ministra-energii-przed-szczytem-klimatycznym-zaplaci-za-to-dymisja/ #dmodify #smog #neuropa show the whole thing source: mapa.png.jpg   +: rzuberbozy, atteint +147 others  ",2018-11-23 09:55:32,BojWhucie,149,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_67gzFCwFI7ZoAts5fjwRJEK4wJrWQqSO,w400.jpg""/>"

How much the PLUS heating election program would do for us, thanks to which it would be a subsidy for the replacement of the furnace with an ecological one and further funding for PLN 1,000 per year for a house. If we paid PLN 500 for a house every 12 years, 12,000 co-financing would be collected every month. We could pay 4 years or run the program after 4 years (so that you do not take as much money from the budget) and give a one-off payment. For those who already have such heating also have gratuities. Of course, a separate program for the apartments.  That's piñset plus, in my opinion, it is such a terrible waste of money that sometimes he gets such a sore ass that the ointments do not help.

202,"               Hi Mirka and Mirabelki, due to the extreme living conditions (Wrocław) I intend to supply myself with air purifiers, after reading the internet I have some questions and doubts about the choice of model / models. At the moment I would like to buy two smaller to two bedrooms (each ~ 37.5 m ^ 3) and a little later one larger to the living room (~ 110 m ^ 3).  To tell the truth, I mainly want to clean the air from the smog, so the moisturizing / ionizing additives are optional and I would even prefer without them, because I do not want sterile too, so that the immune system does not get bored too much. Anyway, from what I read, it is necessary to beware of the purifier and humidifier in one, because more can harm than help, unfortunately I see that quite a few seem quite good purifiers it has and rarely see information about the possibility of not using moisturizing. It would be nice for the purifier to have a night mode and generally be as quiet as possible and able to show me the current state of air pollution.  As for the current offer, it seems that there are a lot of cool Sharps, they have good filters, they are rather quiet, inexpensive to operate but unfortunately almost everyone has a humidifier + ionizer, Philips also seems to have quite interesting products and companies strictly focused on for air purifiers but here is usually much higher price and power, which sometimes seems to me over-inflated form over the content, at least when it comes to bedrooms.  Therefore, here is the question for you, what should I pay special attention to when choosing and do you know or do you have some good purifiers worth recommending?  tags:  show spoiler #zdrowie #oczyszczpadztrza #smog #elektronika #wroclaw  show the whole   +: Dzazder  ",2018-11-20 12:53:36,TrueGrey,1,

The plans for making fifteen seemed doomed to be postponed until another day ... Meanwhile, at last winter came to us - although only -2 ° C, but for that the snow sprinkled (I would say symbolically), while the wind was blowing well and the smog was just below 100% ... so I decided to do without a mask. And because the rest of the way was threatened with a slight slippery, it germinated in my mind the thought of making a repeat of the recent zapierdzielanka in a circle around the estate ...  Or? SAWING! xD  The cheerful thought of squeezing the circles at the very beginning was actually accelerating, and then I continued to accelerate - as far as possible, because of course things went under the hill less well. Everything went great, until I tripped over a protruding pavement tile on the third lap and smashed my stupid head almost ... but my hand was a little rough. Knee too. Nothing that, after returning, I washed everything else in the garage so that my wife would not know (͡º ͜ʖ͡º)  Amazingly, the stumble did not spoil the run - the only thing that changed significantly is the heart rate, which jumped to 170bpm for at least one lap. I do not know why, because I was not even pissed off ... The last element of the run was to buy rolls, and the lady in the bakery traditionally did not hurry with the opening of the premises - so instead of running, buy buns and fly, I went to small loops in the area, so that at a negative temperature do not press under the door. In the end, I succeeded, I bought what I needed and fled home. But through these extra loops, however, it accumulated 15 km.  Effect?

235,"               Mirki, he squeezed the cold and was loud about the smog again. That is why I would like to remind you again about the method of burning in the furnace with coal and wood, which will help reduce the problem of air pollution in an immediate way, because it reduces the emission of pollutants to 50%. In the bonus we have 30% savings on fuel when obtaining the same amount of energy. Smoking with coal can be cleaner. Namely, it is about firing in the stove or fireplace using the method from the top. Did I get your attention? Below you will find out why smoking from the top is better than smoking from the bottom, where you can kindle from above, how to add with this method, you will get a link to the research showing lower emissions, explain popular doubts about this method, explain why it is quiet. I immediately download a brochure in pdf format, which is an extended description of this method. You can print it for yourself, for your family, or throw a smelly neighbor to the cairn to the box. It is several times more likely that it smokes because it kicks coal from the bottom than it burns. I am also available to answer questions under the entry. I also encourage you to share your experiences if someone smokes so. I based my entry largely on the knowledge gained from this blog http://czysteogrzewanie.pl. I encourage you to read and deepen the knowledge about effective heating.  These are now particulars. Almost any type of furnace is suitable for burning from above (see comment below for what is suitable and what is not). You can also light up in fireplaces, which producers even organized a campaign about smoking from the top ""Do not smoke"" There is a belief in the country that the burning of coal must be dirty and kick as hell. Meanwhile, if you kick from the chimney like a steam locomotive, it means that you smoke badly. Together with the smoke, you throw unburned fuel into the atmosphere, which could be burnt in your furnace with another kind of lighting. You save, and at the same time you do not have such an environment.  ** Emissions test results for smoking from above **  What is the advantage of smoking from above over traditional smoking from below? In the burning from the bottom, the entire hopper is immediately heated, the gases contained in the fuel are released, but they have no place to burn, because the heat is at the bottom, near the grate. These gases are flammable, so they could give heat, but in this situation they fly to the chimney unburned and we see them as smoke. Meanwhile, in the burning from the top, under the influence of heat, the gases are released from the fuel and pass through the heat on top, getting better or worse there. Effectiveness of this afterburn depends on how much we will lead the air so-called. secondary to the top of the hopper where combustion takes place, as well as from the boiler structure itself, nevertheless it is always more efficient combustion (i.e. cheaper) than smoking in the same boiler from the bottom.  Are there any cons? I see one, when you start a fire once, you can not add a new portion of fuel to the top, it would be burning from below. If you ignite badly, you will also be able to reach the temperature on the stove longer, but I discuss it below. So how do you add? There is, however, a way to do so. rolling walking. The remaining heat is pushed to the back of the hearth, and in the front, it adds fuel so as not to cover the heat. Fuel will then ignite from the current heat. Another method is to select the heat from the furnace and transfer it to the ash box for a moment. Then, we pour new fuel into the furnace, and we throw the embers from the ash pan on top and burns further. As a last resort, if you do not want to play with it all, and you want to avoid kicking, you can add fuel to the surface in small portions.  Finally, I will answer the doubts I have seen on the Internet from people who have heard about this method and questioned its effectiveness. 1. There is no savings on fuel. It's just an illusion that the fuel from the top is burning up longer. This is not an illusion but the reality resulting from combustion physics from above. If you smoke from the bottom you have thick smoke, which is unburned fuel, and burning from above, the smoke is brighter, it means that in the upper combustion more fuel is burned in the furnace instead of being discharged unused by the chimney. Since we get more energy from the same amount of fuel at the upper combustion, it means that to get the same energy yield as in the bottom combustion, we will consume less fuel. 2. I do not have time to wait 2 hours for it to ignite, I want to have warmth at home immediately! This is probably the biggest lie disseminated about this method of smoking and I get the impression that mainly by people who have never even tried it and do not want to try, that's why they invent such absurd reasons as this without any translation in practice. I reach the temperature of 60 degrees Celsius in my 14 kW oven in half an hour, then I turn on the pump and the house starts to feel warm. Burning from the bottom you can reach this temperature earlier, but does it cost you to save 30% fuel and reduce the emission of pollutants to the atmosphere at the expense of waiting 15-20 minutes longer for heat? What to do if you have problems with reaching the temperature by lighting up from below? First of all, do not regret the secondary air (this is supplied through the upper door), if it is not enough, also increase the primary air supply (bottom door). If there is still something wrong, check if you have a good draft in the chimney. If you have a blower driver, it would be best if you have the option to turn it off and rely on the natural thrust. If this does not pass, you have to experimentally choose the intensity of the blow, as a rule, it should be reduced, in any case set it permanently by hand. The temperature set if you have to set it on the controller at the beginning must be higher than 60 degrees Celsius. Otherwise, you will fire the fuel, which will result in soot, and in the worst case also tar in the furnace. Incidentally, the water temperature in the boiler should always be above 60 degrees Celsius to prevent acid escaping from excessively chilled exhaust gases that will destroy the chimney and dissolve the mortar between the bricks.  Last time I was asked why you can not hear anything about this method, why not show it on TV? There are several reasons. Ecological organizations and anti-smog alarms are incensed by the fact that they are coal, so they will not promote cleaner coal because it is still coal. They write even highly-positioned in Google the sunburn on top of a variety of nonsense and half-truths in the middle, based on research conducted by the Institute whose invention is Blue Coal, purely burned fuel, for which combustion from above is simply a competition that must be fought . The fact that coal will never be 100% pure fuel, but you can burn it 50% cleaner. Can you imagine that everyone is starting to smoke from the top and pollution indicators in one winter without paying any costs are reduced by half? It's worth trying for me. Producers of boilers is also not worth talking about, because new regulations force in the long run to get rid of old boilers, so-called. trash and buying modern 5th class boilers, therefore it is a profit for producers. Why teach that you can burn more cleanly in an old trash, if you can sell a new boiler for 5-10 thousand PLN? While the trash cost 2,000. Still interesting - do you know how modern 5-class class 5 feeder boilers work? On smoking from above. (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) I have the impression that in the public debate on this topic no one takes into account that smoking is not a whim, but a necessity for many Poles because of exploitation costs. I myself have a gas stove at home, but it has been unused for years, because coal heating is significantly cheaper. Many countrymen suspect I chose coal for the same reason.  I am asking for bugs for coverage, I am ready to discuss.  #smog #ecologia #news #zdrowie #polska #palenieodgory #gruparatowaniapoziomu show whole source: czystogrzewanie.pl   +: KiszeKapuste, rzakus +311 others  ",2018-11-18 16:46:55,wilku88,313,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_v3PQFieXtgrhJbbDp2ohZgTnsfagcP7q,w400.jpg""/>"

262,"  China can not cope with the reduction of CO2 emissions  In 2017, a 1.6 percent increase in CO2 emissions was recorded in the PRC (119 million tonnes). This is no surprise, as China has the largest increase in global carbon emissions almost every year in this century.  The reverse trend can be observed in the US, where last year saw the world's largest drop in CO2 emissions (0.5 percent, 42 million tonnes). This is already the 9th time in this century, when the United States recorded the largest decrease in emissions in the world.  China and India are responsible for almost half of global CO2 emissions growth.

352,"  Smog more and more because I decided to buy an air purifier for the room (~ 18 m2). After careful searching, I was most interested in the KC-G Sharp series. In general, I have a question about a new filter that absorbs odors. On many Polish pages it is written that it is a filter with activated carbon and silica gel, I have followed the subject a bit and I have found the sky about what it really is. In official materials, they simply call it ""Inorganic solvent"" and have NOx and SOx absorption properties. I'm not a chemist, but according to I am not a ""solvent"" silica gel. If I'm wrong, I am asking for improvement. However, if it is silica gel, will it not cause drying of the air? (it is often used for drying). However, if it is some other connection, it can cause some allergic reactions, or in some way can be ""dangerous"" to health? I have not found anywhere else to handle this filter in a special way, but I prefer to ask;)  #sharp #purifier #smog #air cleaner #power #air #wawilizer #sprowie show whole   +: schreder  ",2018-11-10 20:29:33,salhir,1,

464,"               FOR THE TURKEY, AS I was. THIS TRIP IS A SERIOUS COMPANY XDDDDD  On October 16, 2012, there was a definite crash in motion around around 7:00. A great company SKM Trójmiasto on her site wrote about DEFECTION (I do not know how it works for you, but for me the defect sounds like scratched varnish, and does not hinder the movement of trains per hour of delay) and that there may be delays up to 15 MINUTES. Do you know what the reality was? Departing at 6:52 from the St. Maksymilian in Gdynia, at 7:40 I was in ... Sopot (8km in over 45min), where we were informed that the train is still not going to Gdańsk, and Gdynia and we are getting off. On the second track there was a clamor towards Gdańsk, but there were so many people in it that there was no option to squeeze in or for ... hundreds of other people. Well, we wait, around 8:00 the next one came in and again in the crush you could set off towards Gdansk. In the main I was around 8: 20-8: 30. So slightly a hour of delay. I wrote to the phone about some sorry that writing about a defect in such a situation is a slight exaggeration, 15 minutes is totally out of information. I would forgive this email if it happened once a year, but such failures become too often. After 3 weeks there is an answer:    An analysis of the delays caused indicates that they were on average 15 - 20 minutes, and therefore there is no basis for considering the information provided as incorrect.

As I am moving, I bought an oxide (and gas) sensor - because I will have gas heating in the apartment. Well, but as here, where I live now, I have gas heating for water ""junkers"", then I gave it to myself for eggs in the bathroom. We'll see, maybe we go on a daily basis ...? I sit quietly, suddenly I hear a squeak. I think ""oh, I wonder how, after all, there is no one in the bathroom, well, outside the smog 9000, so maybe ..."". But no, it's not my sensor, I'm looking after the apartment, and it squeaks from the outside ... I look, and there the ambulance team is calling the fire brigade ""because the sensor is spinning."" It turned out that the neighbor lost consciousness. The neighbors called the ambulance. The ambulance entered the neighbors and their sensors began to beep right away ... As the guards came, they checked everything from the basement to the attic, it was only at those neighbors in the apartment and in the corridor (due to the airing of the apartment). What a coincidence I am assembling today and I see that it is a must ... The ambulance took the young. But how many of those neighbors did not call for help? Or that help would come too late (after poisoning all)?  Really, this is not a big expense, and can save the lives of your and your loved ones. I bought it from Allegro, but now the sensors are almost everywhere available (building markets like Castorama, etc.). I bought for 105 PLN with shipment, version with a sensor of carbon monoxide and flammable gases. After this action I ordered another one for my sister.

485,"               Problems with the credibility of air quality data mainly concern China. It is very often in this country to manipulate pollution measurements. Cases of water spraying around air pollution monitors to hide the readings or inserting cotton wool into air quality tests for filtration are not rare at all. One such case occurred in the city of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province, where officials clogged cotton detectors with air sampling equipment. The situation came to light after the Chinese National Center for Environmental Monitoring (CNEMC) in Beijing detected abnormal data activity from two air quality monitoring stations in Xi'an. Seven officials involved in this practice were sentenced to imprisonment for a year and three months to one year and seven months.  On the attached map you can see how the current state of air (based on AQI USA) looks like in Beijing (1) compared to Warsaw (2), Brussels (3) and Chiba (4).

494,"               South Korea had the second worst air quality from all developed countries in the OECD. Air in South Korea is more than twice as polluted than average for the rest of the world. In 2016, the air in Seoul was considered unhealthy for vulnerable populations (such as children, the elderly and people with respiratory diseases) for 78 days a year. It is estimated that more than half of the pollution comes from local sources, and the rest are blown from China.  On the attached map you can see how the current state of air looks (based on AQI USA) in Shanghai (1) compared to Seoul (2), Warsaw (3) and Himeji (4).

497,"               #krakow what masks against #smog recommend, do you use? Just not something that basically costs PLN 300, and filter 100 PLN for 24 hours, like a respro. Is something trustworthy at a good price, or just masks priced in the price on the wave of the popularity of the problem?   ",2018-11-06 07:26:41,szuwarek-mini,0,
