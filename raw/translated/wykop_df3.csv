Tomorrow the weather is rather under the dog and I think I will keep my strength for the new year, besides why annoy my wife on New Year's Eve? (͡º ͜ʖ͡º)  I was supposed to run yesterday, but when I took out my nose from the garage, the delicate cabbage turned into a regular downpour and I decided that I did not care so much, because the forecasts for the next day were better.  Today I overslept a bit - I was going to start at 6 o'clock, still before dawn ... but how to after the cinema (Green Book - DIVINE FILM, I recommend) goes to zapieksy in a roundabout, returns home at midnight and takes away for mulled wine ... this getting up before 6 medium comes out ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ So I did not start until 7:45, just after the sunrise, which - surprisingly - was even visible for a moment. After this moment, the sky became gray again and it remained so until the end of the race. Fortunately, the forecasts came true perfectly - 2 ° C above zero, strong wind and heavily reduced smog, no rain. Only somehow there was a lack of enthusiasm ... but since I was already outside it was necessary to use, I chose the route 14k with an additional kilometer tongue (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  Again the start was bad - so weak that I almost decided to calm the trot ... but some hope came back on the third kilometer, I accelerated from the hill and - to my own surprise - not only kept the pace, but also did not let me overcome the hill and I slowed only slightly at the run. Then one more flattening, sprinting down ... and suddenly there was hope of breaking 5:00 / km! Nothing but finger injury (I still feel this navicular in some shoes) already approaching 5:00 was a success ... and it succeeded - nice accent at the end of the year, 4:58 min / km ᕙ (⇀‸↼ "" ) ᕗ  The year was successful, for the second year in a row exceeded 3000 km, the pace may not be any killing but bearable ... I wish you Mirki and Mirabelki all the best in the coming year! Good luck running and more!

It is true that the smog was slightly above the norms, but I did not have a mask with me anyway - somehow I will survive ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯  Unfortunately, I was not able to choose my favorite route to Wysokie - my wife listened to the fact that there were wolves in the area and despite my assurances that a meteor would fall on me sooner than a wolf will bite me - I had to run ""safe"" routes from away from the forests ... It was associated with quite sharp ascents, but all in all I did not do any more interesting now that it did not bother me much. Because Zakopianka was building intensively right next to it, the route was quite limited - on the other end I came across such mud that it was not in my head to run any further.  I must say that it was nice despite the sharp mountain, I did not lose much on the ascents, and I got a lot from running Górka. With these 20 km and 275m uphill, the result 4:52 min / km is considered even acceptable.  And finally I got two dicons ᕙ (⇀‸↼ "") ᕗ I missed it like hell ...  We'll see how tomorrow - at first I was not going to run in the morning, but forecasts suggest that it may not be so bad and instead of rain the morning will greet me with snow ... It will be difficult to resist temptation (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °).

It may be disturbing, however, the discovery that impurities in the air also affect the state of our minds. Can contaminated air contribute to the decline in intelligence? It turns out that this way: as research conducted in China shows, air pollution is a factor that has a significant impact on our mental fitness. To test the relationship between air purity and mental decline, Chinese researchers turned to China Family Panel Studies, which regularly conducts specific intelligence tests among the population of this country. This organization provided the researchers with the results of tests carried out on up to 20,000 people. The researchers then checked the difference between the results over four years and then compared them to the level of pollution in the provinces they came from. The results give food for thought. As one of the authors of the Xi Chen study explains, ""air pollution can make us go back in education one year back."" He also warns that this problem applies especially to the elderly and people whose educational level is less than the average. In such cases, the drop in the level of education can be even several times greater. This discovery is so disturbing that researchers do not know what exactly causes the decline in brain function. As the ""main suspect"", the so-called a white substance on which air pollution can have a particularly negative effect. However, to confirm this, further research will be needed. . show the whole source: budujemydom.pl   +: billiard, Majronn  ",2018-12-21 23:57:29,Nightmare16,2,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_nQvk2lQkpmhsoC6ZWCmcEZMFqjm8XtDI,w400.jpg""/>"

When paying with a currency card attached to PayPala, you should also follow these steps: https: //www.wykop.pl/wpis/25914651/co-zrobic-aby-paypal-obciazyl-karte-walutowa-bez-p/   ** 2. Do you take parcel insurance? **   It's better to take for more expensive purchases.   ** 3. Which shipment to choose? **   For Banggood, the parcel reducing the chance for VAT is Priority Direct Mail (PDM) and European Direct Mail (EDM). For Gearbest Priority Line (is available for selected products in Chinese warehouse) - this type of shipment reduces the chances of VAT. Other types of parcels do not reduce the chances of VAT, but it is better to take a registered air mail (I think it is best to choose Belgium Registered, then Europe Registered, at the end of PostNL.) Than unregistered, which sometimes can go a long way (of course it can also be registered so long). If it's 60 days, and we still do not have packages, write to Gearbest.

98,"               [#baluckieopowiesci - ""Kara mustafa""]  In high school, I had a man in the class who had problems - I do not know if he was suffering from asperger or if it was already autism. Contact with him was difficult - but he reacted normally, sometimes he even smiled. Sympathetic and basically unfriendly. A very good learner, a man with a passion for mathematics and physics. He knew a lot and somehow tried to help although he had problems with communication problems.  Teachers respected this man very much, we also liked him. Although sometimes the guys ridiculed him as he roamed the school corridors both inside and outside. There were a couple of slides in the school - well, it was not a typical high school girl only profiled in principle, such a little technical school with the option of high school. Comedy of the Polish education system.  That is why Przemek's walks drew the weight of those with. Sometimes they threw him money at his feet, but it was not dangerous. Several times our class homies have been dealing with them about it. Well, all in all a colleague had some problems and you had to protect him. Nobody would let a man get hurt because we would have a stain on honor as a class. In total, you know, people, I can say with a hand on my heart I had fronts in the face. Really.  Przemek one day caught a school gangus - a packed with steroids, a piece of meat with a peanut-sized brain. He knocked him down - luckily, the rest of my class came to him and just jerked - for what it was then roaring because I also had a Cossack, but with a good heart and had a pair in my paws. That until he rejected. We raised our friend and returned to our class. Gangusowi nothing to disregard on honor he lost nothing. All the time we were threatened with death then XD and colleagues. Normal bream in total.  How was he later dug in XD  I sit one day in the library and take samples (then I had a cosmic weak link at home - 2005) and this Neanderthal XD sticks there. It was a period when TV presented an ambitious TV program about Miriam's life - trance woman. This idiot found the naked photos of this stick and set it on the school computer as wallpaper. It was unfortunate that at that time the director had just entered the library - such a low XD texan guard and how he saw it ... Interrogated us - everyone asked if this guy was aggressive? He just because he did not leave school, that his mother asked him to finish this sports class XD and had some perspective.  To tell the truth, it's a pity Przemek has so far - the guy always was uphill and yet such an action happened to him. Bałuty is such a jungle (though lately smog smells more of a hell) and here people are not treated with respect. Maybe in other years it has changed, but it was not good in mine.  Respect your colleagues, those weaker and not always chad, srad or other pseudo wins. The real win is the one who can bend over the fate of the weak and those whose life is not littered with roses. Do not listen to others who say otherwise. It's not worth being a motherfucker in my life.

141,"  The only ones punished with the DIESELGATE scandal in Poland? An association that fights Volkswagen!  For the first time we reveal this information - and we count on Wykop Efekt in the interest of all of us. Because if someone thinks that you can fight for justice in Poland and punish a dishonest company that admits mass deception and produce cars that poison our air en masse, it is very wrong.  Three years after the outbreak of the scandal, the only one punished is ... our association:  1. The District Court in Warsaw dismissed the class action and ordered StopVW to pay almost PLN 100,000 to Volkswagen in a bizarre verdict! Judge Joanna Bitner was motivated by the fact that ... several thousand people applied to the Association. At the same time, she told us to look for justice in ... Germany.  2. It is worth noting that Judge Joanna Bitner is the president of the District Court in Warsaw, she was appointed by Zbigniew Ziobro. Her behavior at the dieselgate hearing was significantly different from the standards of the judiciary, which is why we complained to her and we will consistently strive to punish her.  3. The Appellate Court did not refer to the appeal at all, but only in a short decision upheld the verdict of the District Court. The justification was very laconic. Now we are faced with the necessity to pay PLN 100,000, which is quite a challenge for the small Association, which lives on volunteers. But we will not give up! On Friday, we filed a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court. The cost of such a cassation is tens of thousands of zlotys. However, we are going to bring this matter to a close, because it can not be possible to punish cheaters in a 40 million country.  4. The proceedings regarding our association were initiated ... attention, no one else, but ... UOKiK! The allegations will be published soon on our website, they are quite absurd. The same UOKiK can not punish Volkswagen for three years. Case?  Which offices and officials do not have any effects in the fight against DIESELGATE  Ministry of Infrastructure, Minister Andrzej Adamczyk - repeatedly informed by us about the problem. The effects are not visible yet - the Ministry claims that everything is OK and 200,000 thousand cars are still in the best,  Transport Technical Supervision - Jan Urbanowicz. This is just an interesting institution. They will allow us to go to court ... for defamation, for saying that they could do the most. The effects of the work can not be seen. Cars are faulty as they drive so they drive.  UOKiK - President Marek Niechciał, the matter is overseen by Dorota Karczewska, vice president. For three years he has not punished Volkswagen or zloty. The evidence is cited, STOPVW has provided stewards with documentation. Did the office initiate proceedings against us in response?  Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki - repeatedly asked to act in writing. He did not deign to answer.  Zbigniew Ziobro, Patryk Jaki - repeatedly informed in writing about the case, the lack of answers is short. Their people were informed directly. The effects of their actions are also not visible.  President Andrzej Duda - informed about dieselgate, has maintained a dignified silence.  MINI FAQ - But what is it all about?  1. What is this dieselgate? The affair is that cars with Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, SEAT and Porsche diesel engines have installed software that cheats exhaust tests. Cars do not meet the standards that have been entered in the documents and emit huge amounts of harmful nitrogen oxides.  2. What are nitrogen oxides and why should they harm me? This is one of the basic components of smog, a gas that causes protein degeneration and damage in the body, leads to complications, respiratory diseases and, above all, premature deaths.  3. Does anyone measure it? No, in Poland there is no effective system for measuring nitrogen oxides in the air.  4. SMOG and nitrogen oxides? Yes, nitrogen oxides very much like dust and create a beautiful, deadly smog. As a result, about 120 people die each day in Poland.  5. The scandal was detected in 2015. But what then? Poisonous cars were revealed even later, which meant that despite the scandal, Volkswagen continued to produce cheated cars.  6. Why does the Polish government like Skoda and Volkswagen so much? We do not know. Maybe there is a second and third bottom.  7. I do not have Skoda, Volkswagen, SEAT or Porsche or Audi, how to live? Living with the awareness that around 200,000 cars emit tens of times more nitrogen oxides every day than predicted norms can not be simple. Especially in big cities.  8. I have a child / elderly at home. What about these nitrogen oxides? Avoid walking on the main roads. Nitrogen oxides are much more harmful than other pollutants.  9. Old diesels more! The kopeck may be, but contrary to appearances, they are cleaner than the exhaust fumes from cheated Volkswagen.  10. Do you like Volkswagen, Skoda, Audi, SEATy, Porsche? Sure, it used to be very cool cars, otherwise we would not buy them.  11. The manufacturer has reportedly proposed a repair action in the form of a software update? Helps? In our opinion, we do not and we advise against - the result is higher combustion and worse for the user the curve of power and torque, while the update does not solve the problem of compliance with Euro standards - in the opinion of our experts.  12. I have such a car out of the affair, what's the problem? First of all, you are rubbing the environment and yourself by the way, secondly the producer left you on the ice.  13. My car is not in the tool for checking on the manufacturer's website. Can I have a cheated engine? Yes, we have a lot of such cases. We have notified UOKiK about this. The effects can not be seen.  14. Can I join you? Help me something.

I left only at 7:15, because I wanted to let go of the lead - the mask was not needed, because the smog was still dispelled and on the thermometer nice -3 ° C and a slight breeze. Due to the fact that it could have been slippery, I founded Canadie ... and good and bad. Okay, because the servants got wrapped up and there was mud in the place instead of snow, badly - because in those shoes the finger again showed up and you had to fire up ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯  In general, today was something slower - the first kilometer very slippery and uncertain, the last one the same, and on the way even as such ... but without revelations. Somehow today I was generally not in the mood for longer running so all in all the plan was made.

192,"               A week ago I made a breakthrough, because that's how you can call the replacement of a boiler controller. The new controller controls the temperature on the boiler and buffer, the set start temperature of 65 ° C, as the temperature of the buffer> boiler temp. Switches off the pump.  A considerable convenience, which only confirms the ignorance of the fitter, who claimed, ""Mister ladies, why sensor on buffer?"" Now I light up every 24 hours.  Improvements remain to be made:  - insulation of the expansion tank with mineral wool - inserting three-way valves in front of the manifolds on the radiators on the floors - furnace replacement for the 5th class, probably Defro DS 10 kW.  Fuel 25 kg in total burned in 4-5 hours is enough for 24 hours of heating in weather -5 ° C - 0 °. C. In the side walls, I just closed the holes with PUR foam, so if the house was ""surrounded"" by neighbors from two sides, it would probably be burning every other day. Below in the comments I will paste the temperature graphs during the firing up and cooling down of the buffer.  @ kurzi5 @dziecielinapala @kibiklops @Solitary_Man @OldNoob @Silikon @Serv_HVAC @ anty-fronda @ nintendo89 @kocha_to_poczka @Juzef @kijek_samobijek @Basteq @ jaceks653 @tRNA @ rumun6925 @Trelik @Fafnucek @ PanKracy582 @dump @burtton @ PawelW124 @Astroc @ W33D420 @ lis6502 @mrjetro @Trelik @Fafnucek @dump @pierzak @ Dawidu22 @kryniol @Cronox @bialyWilk @ mic120 #heating #zima #smog show the whole source: IMG_20181216_110433.jpg   +: pierzak, mic120 +34 others  ",2018-12-16 11:14:58,goothic,36,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_MuqPRIa9k4MHxiWYJEZik52eGpU58N4w,w400.jpg""/>"

207,"               @AloesPolska: Wrinkles? Not as horrible as it seems - there are ways. Change your lifestyle, change your mood and look!  Wrinkles are folds and skin deformations that appear as you age. Over the years, the skin loses elasticity, resulting in lines or small scratches that later become wrinkled text. Causes: When we age, sweat and sebaceous glands that provide the skin with moisture and fat, wear out and gradually stop working. This causes the skin to lose its elasticity and humidity. As a result, it becomes dry and breaks appear on it. It also starts to lose collagen, which keeps the skin of the face and body in good condition. Lack of collagen results in flaccid tissue, double chins, wrinkles around the neck, around the mouth, around the eyes (""crow's feet""), bags under the eyes etc. Destruction of collagen and other tissues is caused by the presence of free radicals, mainly produced by the sun, smog and adverse environmental impact.  The main causes of wrinkles  - no humidity (dehydration) - the creation of free radicals that oxidize tissues under the influence of sunlight (UV) strongest between 11:00 and 15:00 -smog and dry, destructive environment -mask face - wrinkles also causes a rough surface of the pillowcase - no vitamins A, B, C, E and minerals. Suggested supplementation and what to change in a lifestyle to improve the condition of our skin ?:  - avoid excessive tanning; according to Dr. Stephen Kurtin, this is the best way to prevent wrinkles - protect the face with creams with sunscreen - wear sunglasses with large lenses to prevent rays falling on the skin around the eyes -pow large amounts of water, as well as aloe juice to moisturize the skin -take multiminerals and vitamins A, B, C and E. Beta-carotene (provitamin A) and vitamins C, E are very effective in neutralizing free radicals - use soft fiber cushions or sleep supine; try to avoid mimic contractions; - Massage each face gently for about 2 minutes to stimulate circulation -use moisturizing creams - the reason for the deterioration of the skin condition is seen in the reduction of certain hormones involved in the transport of fats to the cells by the appropriate glands. This causes a loss of balance of these fats partly due to the presence of free radicals in cells, glands and tissues throughout the body. -Release and change the skin! - Do not smoke - they damage the radiant appearance of the skin and affect the color of the teeth  PEELING (removal of the top layer of the skin) There are substances like phenol and its derivatives that are used to remove or remove the top layer of the skin (damaged and wrinkled). This supplementation in most cases causes a complete change of skin on the face, eliminating or reducing wrinkles and scars. It can cause skin blemishes. There are also less harmful substances that slower remove the top layer of the skin, e.g. retinol and retin-A. This product is also effective in the fight against acne. The results of this treatment come slower, but it is safer.  AHA Alpha-hydroxy acids Currently, other series of chemical exfoliants (peeling) and strong irrigation agents such as alpha-hydroxy acids have been discovered. These acids are combined (depending on the manufacturer) with other ingredients, e.g. Aloe vera, to obtain a different characteristic. An example of such an acid type is glycolic acid. These products remove dead epidermal cells and hydrate the skin. With constant use, they make big changes in the appearance of the skin, renewing and rejuvenating it. The best products are made of acids from natural sources such as fruits. The best combination is the combination of these acids with the aloe pulp, because the aloe penetrates deeply rebuilding the skin cells and eliminating possible irritations.

217,"               At night I did not sleep because I could not fall asleep so I went to bed at 19:00 and woke up at 21:50. I had a nice dream, which I remembered very carefully. Well, I'm riding a bicycle to work in the morning and in the yard of the last house on the right before the bend I see something colorful. It had strange shapes. I did not have time to look at it, and besides it was far away so I go on. Around the bend, I see a thick, light-gray smoke fly from the chimney of this house, and it falls straight down onto the road in front of me, where it rolls around on the road. The smoke was strange, it had a homogeneous, light gray color, something like soiled milk and it did not mix with the air. The closer I was, the sharper the stench I felt. Something like a stench of burning plastic multiplied by ten glue or solvent mixed with stench. I think that if I eat this smoke I will not leave because even if it is not poisonous and I was sure it is, I will simply suffocate because it was thick and not mixed with the air. So I turned back, put my bike on the fence and crossed the gate to tell the mob that if they did not stop smoking so soon, I would call the police. I look, and there is Korwin with a white suit and hat behind the corner of the house, and the frightened marriage of some old men holding hands behind him. Outraged Korwin said loudly: ""You can smoke things in a furnace with various things, but that's an exaggeration! I have small children and you poison the air!"" Being in the yard, I could take a closer look at this colorful something. It looked like colored coal with longitudinal shapes. I thought it was probably a pile of leftists. After a while, the police arrived, cheery policemen saw what and how immediately they fixed the mandate 700 zloties to the elderly and the second wanted to glue Korwinowi, not really known for what. I guess that he did not call the police right away, he only went to spoil the stinks first. Korwin said that he could afford to pay the ticket but he would not be able to pay such an unfair mandate and would not accept him, let him be locked up in prison. After a while, the second police car arrived and the police jointly announced that they would call the boss, let him worry. The boss came, but Korwin did not want to accept the ticket from him either. Well, the boss called his boss, then the head of the boss called the next boss, etc. Finally stood in front of the house with ten police cars and blocked the road, which in the meantime from the rural, local road became an arrow straight on the highway and the winter turned into spring (I think that this presence of Corvinus affected the acceleration of economic growth and global warming). A multi-kilometer long queue took place on the highway, and the debating police officers advised that they would call Jasia. I went to the side of the highway and when I left about a kilometer I noticed that the driver of a truck taking advantage of the opportunity crashes into the ditch these strange rainbow lumps. I ran back to the police to inform them of littering, but nobody paid any attention to me. After a moment, Jaś came. He was short, about forty, and his heavily tanned and wind-dried skin was a body full of tense muscles and tendons. On his face he had glasses like Sylwester Stallone in the movie ""Cobra"" and looked like general Polko. When Korwin saw him, he froze for a moment and then he shouted: ""Hansel ?! But you grew up, I have not seen you for centuries."" It turned out that Jaś was a neighbor of Korwin, who for a kid went fishing with him and then became a commando and a policeman. Jaś listened to what was going on and told everyone to go home. End.  #korwin #sen #smog show the whole   +: Rennie-  ",2018-12-12 22:34:50,PanDzikus,1,
