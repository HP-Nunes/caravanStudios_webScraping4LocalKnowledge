1,"  Salty bill for smog. 30 billion euros per year and 19 thousand deaths - this is official data <<< find In 2016, 15,000 died due to smog. people in urban areas and 4 thousand in rural areas, and the cost associated with it is from 12.8 to 30 billion euros (even over 120 billion zlotys). And these are not the claims of 'green shocks' but the official data provided by the Ministry. This can not be simply denied.  Other studies show that these deaths could be as much as 50,000 a year, and the costs would be much higher.  So the question - how long will the Poles trade their health in favor of the coal lobby?  As someone rightly pointed out - Poles in summer can be poisoned by immoral businessmen importing rubbish into Poland, then burning them in ""unusual"" circumstances, and in the winter selling the worst coal, all with the consent of political elites for years maintaining the existence of these practices.

6,"               Just think about a year ago, no one could have predicted that the extremely friendly Kadanyjczyk, the father of the talented Lance Stoll, will be bought by a British team led by Claire Williams, a half-Indian Force India team. However, it is here that a completely new story is written in front of our eyes. A story that surprises, shocks and moves. Ladies and Gentlemen, today is a special day, this country, this place and this track. It will become home again for all Poles gathered in front of TV sets and those on the track. Today in Italy, the language of Poland will become the official language. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza track in a city and municipality in northern Italy, in the Lombardy region, in the provinces of Monza and Brianza.  We are on August 31, the year of the Lord's year 2018. Gray clouds are standing over the Italian track. A sulphurous, dense rain is reflected off the hulls of the cars. Today, the contractor probably forgot that his wife is waiting for him at home, because every now and then he shows scantily dressed but tightly clothed with fan cloaks, Fan Girls standing on grand grandstands. If it was not 31 August 2018, they would probably have stolen the whole show.  Nothing could be more wrong. Supporters, fans, poles and poles in front of TVs and on the track look in the screens and ahead of them in search of only one, an exceptionally nice car, a car that is to give after twelve years of separation what they call adrealine.  Polish - red adrealine, which flows in the veins and arteries of the Polish citizen of the heart of the High Lord, Robert Kubica. The director changes the frame. Crowds start to sing the barge by drowning the firing engines. Drivers from outside the range, jumping into their narrow cockpits, raise the left hand, the left hand Robert almost lost in racing less than 50 km away. They raise her in a greeting gesture of the new old and how racial Williams driver. The helicopter of the television crew creates a protective overcoat over the Polish car, whose car or coverall or even the visor is not scaled with one drop of rain.  Mechanics converge on the track. Everyone, however, runs next to the Polish car, they want to touch the wheel, they want to touch the smallest flight of Robert Kubica's car. Man of an iron, steadfast, outstanding racing driver from Wawel.  Flames emerge from the exhaust pipes of the cars, the Cracovian's car blows with fire like a Wawel smog. The fire crashes, wraps the exhaust pipes heated to red.  The contractor from a distance shows the boss in the garage - Claire Williams, a woman nymph, a perfect woman, an ideal woman - who gave her a chance that, like the famous Angela Merkel, has everything in check.  An installation lap passes ...  Frank pushes the lights from the start. Suddenly, in just a moment, in just a few moments, they will be moving in a few moments. Najperw ignites one, then two, then three and more red as roses which guests brought to comfort Robert after the tragic in Italy in rallies. Red as the cockpit of a Ferrari car with which Mr. Robert had a contract signed.  R U S Z A J Ą! A scream, a squeak, a crash, a slide is indescribable. Jazzm, buzz, disorder, boiler, the boom of the cars crash in the drums of the most effective fans.  At the very beginning, in the home race, at home Bettel's red car collides with Raikonnen, Verstappen joins Bottas, Hamilton raises his hand in a gesture of anger at the Riccardo raining man attacking him. Right behind them, after a beautiful start, after the third corner, on the seventh place, he goes.  A little further, trying to turn on more than four Sergei, who prefers to watch everything behind. Which has one task today. Clean the rear, be the worse, but the necessary link to receive the target. Being a winger, learning and watching, like a real alpha and omega, the only one, erudite, authority wins his prey.  The race is on. Black clouds over the track are even darker. Claire Williams watches everything from the garage with headphones on, in golf and with folded arms. Paddy Love sits in a rain jacket over colorful charts.  In the end, Kubica goes for the second set of tires. Astonishing pace, amazing times recording on the last laps bring him closer to Verstappen, who goes on dilapidated tires. Max gets information on the radio that he loses 3 seconds to Bottas, and Fin goes on even worse tires. The battle begins with time, Max, a Formula One gold child with his Red Bull is catching up with boring Fin.  Everyone under the TV breathlessly watches the last lap of the race for the Italian Grand Prix, the German who won here his first race, World Champion Sebastian Vettel wins, screams TUTUTUTUT, GRANDE RAGAZZIE, TUTI FRUTTII, GRANDE MACHINA, Italian flags are flying over the track, Everyone is waiting for third driver.  Verstappen, Bottas, and Kubica go head to head. The heart of the fans in Poland is beating stronger and harder, and the blood in the veins is flowing faster, faster and faster. They speed over 350 km / h. In just a moment, their last tight spaces are waiting for them, one of the most dangerous places that inconvenient drivers frequently come across. The fans get up from the seats, a few hundred meters away and everything will be known. Kubica and Bottas with DRS enabled. And suddenly, suddenly something comes that the whole world, the paddock, everyone gathered in Italy and TVs could not expect.  Bottas attacks Verstappen, goes to the inside and suddenly a silver Mercedes car hits him. They collided! Bottas bounces, Verstappen passes through chicane, fights, but suddenly, next to these two drivers, the whole car passes white, not a rain drop, Pole National Big Brother Mr. Robert Kubica first of all heads Williams podium, to crown the entire work of the whole team, for new hope, for hope for Kler and Padi. Closer to Williams's garages, drivers in helmets together with Sieroż celebrate Orthodox services, pray for him to arrive, he is whole and healthy.  FINALLY, THE LAST RANGE JESTEYTTT JEEEESTTT POLACOOOO VITOOORIAAA is shouting by commentators in Italian TV stations. Claire is flooding with tears. Edyta was Robert Kubica's fiancée sobbing.  Paddy Love, reports on the radio, kisses the receiver, Sirotkin joins and congratulates in Russian Suka Bljat, Robert, Pozdravleniya, otlichnaya gonka  The entire paddock and all journalists announce that RK slapped after this success until the end of the season. The fans in a gesture of triumph take off the green color from the Italian flag and here the Polish flags are flying over the track in Italy. Monza becomes the second Warsaw, Poznań and Krakow.  And suddenly on the podium after the race he enters ""all in white"" as an extremely important on the third place, all over 7 years of separation, raises the cup, although slight tears in his eyes smoldering Robert and all the crying on television along with the Pole.  Then, after the decoration, all drivers with Frank Williams, dr. Mario Theissen, Nico Rosberg, Heidfeld, Flvio Bratore, Claire Williams, Lovem appear on the stage.  Alonso is crying, he screams now you can fight! Gasly screams with the Spaniard. Heidfeld lets go and says: Du hast huju gewonnen!  Vettel Raikonnem open champagne Robert Riccardo pours himself of this opportunity to boot, the water, and suddenly the clatter Robert pole takes the microphone in his left hand and a broken voice saying that ....

12,"               HURRR DURRR eco-terrorists on the Germanic belt Polish-devoured #dimages #smog #przyroda #zdrowie #neuropa    At the end of July, Krzysztof Tchórzewski prepared a regulation allowing for the sale of fine coal to individuals. Only coal companies and trade unions of miners got to the consultations. In addition, they took place in the long August weekend.    But the clever plan of the minister was reviewed by environmental organizations. Polish Smog Alert and Małopolski Marshal Jacek Krupa raised the ninth: the regulation of Krzysztof Tchórzewski is contrary to the government's program Clean Air and anti-smog resolution for Małopolska.    It turns out that in the annex to the document, which lists the coal grades admitted for sale in individual farms, the first one was poisonous coal dust containing, inter alia, sulfur (1.8%) and ash (28%). This makes it difficult to burn - and they do not want to buy it, heating plants or power plants, which have imposed strict emission standards for the atmosphere. And this is what it has been the substance, the combustion of which contributes the most to air pollution and the formation of smog. https://strajk.eu/minister-energii-chce-truc-polske-zdemaskowany-przez-ekologow/ show the whole source: dz01NDAmaD0zNjA_src_195654-smog_w_polsce_walka_zd2_budujemydompl.jpg   +: zaltar, Stan_Przedzalalowy +12 others  ",2018-08-22 10:23:28,BojWhucie,14,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_uhJv12WDde8OHPWcB5EonEXlgxFrgsd3,w400.jpg""/>"

employee for the lowest, that is, the cost of about PLN 3000 for the employer in exchange for 40 hours of work per week? or maybe a robot working 168 hours a week? it's more than 4 times as much ... more efficient work ... and it does not have to have artificial intelligence, it's enough to properly erase goods and handle payment, of course with a card, that is what a ticket machine can do right now, you do not need a military class terminator with AI to beat a man in such a position, delete goods, display receipts, easy  I omit the fact that the robot can take out the goods in 5 seconds and immediately put the bill and pour them on the cart, just something like a production tape, only with code scanners, and code on each side of the product packaging, in case the client puts them as  quick maths: salary * months * years * number of hours per week at the robot 3000 zlotys * 13 months * 5 years * 4.2 = PLN 819000 - the cost of 4.2 employee for 5 years  on a 5-year scale: if the robot does not spoil for 5 years, if its price is lower than 819000 PLN, then man is not allowed to live (actually 4.2 man, because one man has no chance to work 168 hours a week)  let such a miracle cost PLN 500000, then it will be cheaper than more than 4 people, it will be more efficient because there are no breaks and humors and automatic scanning of 20 products at a time, and the best thing is that after working out in the working hours of those 500,000 PLN, you only work for free, you pay the equivalent of work for five years, and the robot breaks down after 12, you are 7 years old for free  and I would forget, a small shop will not spend PLN 500000 on a robot, leasing / renting here, 4.2 people is PLN 12,600 per month, a robot can cost PLN 4,000 per month, pay for it after 10 years, after 10 years it becomes the property of the store and works for free, OVERKILL how you look, and this is just one profession  this magic trick is enough for a manager / IT specialist watching 20 cash registers  I counted for the lowest national, if you pay more to employees than the lowest, you will gain many times more  soon the skeptics will write that it will not work, xD 1 - you set a standard for special packaging of products (it already works but for bar codes) which makes it easier to dispose of garbage because you have a standard (plus) and easier transport, because cube or cuboid does not waste space, etc. etc. can be exchanged so far 2 - the code is on all sides because it is small, the client simply sets the products on the counter, the robot scans them and immediately drops to the basket, instead of waving a hand like a debil just has a continuous taped, and how to throw products as it flies after the seconds are already in the basket, just an xD scanner 3 - end, we issue a receipt, peak payment card, next customer  basically, instead of codes, there may be transmitters (NO DO NOT CROP, IT IS ALREADY FUNCTIONING), theoretically you can scan the entire cart by going through the gate, but here comes the unnecessary High-Tech, my previous solution would work now xD  I warn you about the power failure, a month ago there was a power failure and I did not make purchases in the supermarket, so I wish you would need electricity today even ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯  I want to show how proliferating and large families are propagating, children will not have a job if there are more of us, because robots are already better in most things, there is enough person in the factory to look after the machine, no one is able to work faster than the assembly tape from this decade, let alone High-Tech in 20 years, I do not even pity them  in addition, we will not even feel that there are more people, the only thing we will feel is the smog and lack of jobs  courier?

31,"               Barbara Chrobak, MP Kukiz'15, submitted to the Minister of Health and the Minister of the Environment an interplacement on chemtrails (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)    Citizens have expressed their concern about the procedure of spraying in the atmosphere of harmful substances with a request to take action to explain whether the programs of weather modification and management of solar radiation take place over the territory of Poland with the knowledge of the government. Other names are: chemtrails, chemical streaks, geoengineering, geoengineering of the climate. There are dozens of patents regarding weather modification and artificial cloud formation by spraying particles in the atmosphere.    Citizens who observe this phenomenon argue that the geoengineering procedures take place with varying intensity for most days of the year. The number of Poles aware of these activities can be estimated in tens of thousands, including groups on social networks and others. This is not a small number, considering the fact that this issue is practically not discussed in the mainstream media in Poland so far. On the Internet, you can find hundreds of thousands of photos and videos depicting these activities.    From the accounts of people observing geoengineering sprays, it appears that the so-called smog is much more intense on days when these activities are carried out. It could be the answer to the question why the smog several years ago was not such a problem, despite the fact that the heating and used mainly coal, and industrial production was higher. Increased number of cars on the roads is not the answer to this question, because, as experience shows large western cities, where significantly reduced car traffic, smog decreased only slightly.

It is possible that subsidies to replace furnaces or to improve thermal insulation of buildings will soon start. Fragments and tags below.    The problem could not be dealt with by the previous governments, and the current one, despite the loud announcements, goes like it was after december. In recent months, the government plenipotentiary for smog, Piotr Woźniak, has announced that the World Bank report will be an indication of what steps to take to fight smog. The report was released a month ago. Which contains?    Maybe first from the end. WB shows what effects the implementation of its recommendations will entail. First of all - it will be a significant decrease in the use of coal for heating single-family houses. The analysis assumes that all houses that have access to the natural gas network (about 40 percent), will change the heating from mugs to gas boilers, which is just like over 30 years ago in the West. Another 4 percent without access to the gas network, it will switch to electric heating. In other single-family houses, old solid-fuel furnaces will have to be replaced with new ones that comply with the standards of the Ecodesign Directive and anti-smog resolutions.    According to the World Bank's recommendations, poor people (around 450,000 people in the country) who are heating their homes with kilns deserve a subsidy of 90-100 percent. investment value. The report estimates that in this group of houses about 80 percent. I need thermo-modernization (360,000). The remaining subsidies would concern the costs of replacing the furnace and the heating system.    A large part of the report seems to have been reflected in the announcements of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. At the beginning of June, he announced the Clean Air program at the conference, claiming that PLN 130 billion was earmarked for its implementation. In the WB report, a similar number is also reported - PLN 130.5 billion, and it concerns the scale of all investments necessary to make people who are not poor in homes. Together with investments in homes of the energy poor, the scale of expenditure increases to PLN 154 billion.    Call for proposals for access to funds in the NFOŚiGW program ""Clean Air"" for voivodship environmental protection funds will be implemented most probably from August.

47,"               Hello! I'm just buying a flat (~ 73m, one level + garden) and I'm wondering how to install #smarthome #inteligentnydom without bothering in the walls and reworking the existing installation. I base everything on #raspberrypi 2, which I already have and #domotich, which I am already testing. I also know about loyal #homeassistant and #openhab - maybe one day migration to another system, but for now domoticz will be ok. Raspberry will be connected on the router to the central point of the apartment, and the modules and sensors in cans.  I wonder if: - # esp8266 (in sets with inverter and relay and sonoff) - #rflink (set with nodo-shop.nl) - #zwave (razberry or usb-stick?)  What devices with which system work best? What are their pros and cons? Probably I will choose 2, because I probably will not be able to base all devices and sensors on one.  Of course, I will not do everything right away. At the beginning I would like to: - control external blinds (maintaining the functionality of physical buttons) (blebox? with-wave? relays + esp8266?) - controlling the solenoid valve for watering the garden - control of floor heating valves (all valves in one place) - here danfoss z-wave heads? - temperature sensors in each room - weather station (temp, humidity, pressure, smog) outside.  Then comes: - lighting control retains the functionality of physical buttons, - control of sockets, - motion detectors, illuminance, precipitation sensor  Known topic, but I would like to know what people recommend using a solution?

49,"   In the United Kingdom, there are more schools that have banned parents from taking their children to school in cars.   Instead, the so-called Park and walk, which consist in the fact that the school gets along with, for example, a local supermarket and that provides its parking (...)    The motivation is to care for health. On the one hand, it's about air quality, which the British attach more and more importance to and attention to the harmfulness of fumes for young people. On the other hand, fear of deductions and safety at the crossings and streets in front of schools.    Some schools try to promote the conversion of the car to their own feet and organize various competitions for this purpose. Others simply close the streets in front of the buildings. For example, nine schools in Edinburgh have already done so. The newspaper also lists five in London's Hackney, they emphasize that soon it will do 12 more. A similar solution will be introduced by Westminster from September. The most interesting solution, however, is the combination of entry bans with the so-called ""Park and stride"". It depends on the fact that the schools get along with those who have a parking lot nearby - a supermarket, a church, and sometimes even a pub to make the place available to parents. It is important that the walk is not too long. Usually, it takes a few minutes for the child to go to school.  https://smoglab.pl/kolejne-brytyjskie-szkoly-zabraniaja-dowozenia-dzieci-samochodami-zamiast-tego-parkuj-i-spaceruj/  #smog #dziecin #samochody #bezpieczenstwo #rodzice #ciebiostki show the whole   +: benzdriver, Gosir +1 other  ",2018-07-17 11:39:29,Fidelis,3,

51,"               Hey people from #krakow and #rowerowykrakow. There is such an action - recently I am cycling through Kolna street in Krk and I feel the burning of plastic. A bit further appeared ... a building with white smoke. I called the municipal police, they received the notification. The next day, I called SM asking if they had done something about it, but unfortunately, they took a different subject, and they arrived a few hours after the fact and nothing was burning ...  I suggest to do a small #csiwykop action and drive to the place of garbage burning, check if the plastic is burning, if so, call SM (No. 986). I will do it in the near future, but if more people join the action, we will increase the chance of success :)  Kolna Street is just next to Tyniec, the Vistula embankments, Skotniki Uroczysko Park etc. - there are many bicycle routes around, just a tad off the main road.

58,"  Gothenburg. An electro-revolution in the city of Volvo <<< find The half-millionth Goeteborg introduces electric buses very slowly, step by step. In contrast to Poland, where electrobuses are the main element of the revolution in public transport, there is a lot going on around the Swedish city, and vehicles are just the crowning of a series of changes.    - We do not have coal in Sweden! - replied after a moment the head of transport in the Vastra Gotaland region, when he heard the question of whether an electric bus is not replacing the smog from the exhaust pipe to the smog from the chimney of the power plant. The question, which is one of the main arguments on the electrobuses over the Vistula, does not make sense in Sweden. Most of the energy is generated by hydroelectric power plants, a large part - nuclear power plants, but these are slowly switched off. In Vastra Gotaland, whose capital is Goeteborg some time ago, it was assumed that by 2025 all public transport vehicles will use renewable energy. The date quickly turned out to be pointless, because today this ratio reaches 96 percent.    Gothenburg. From the right: Buspas (double), stop for articulated electrobuses, green belt, roadway for cars with the width of the Polish bicycle path. More on the left is the right bicycle path and sidewalk.

76,"               A few years ago, we were with a wife in Iran. Smog, heat, uninfected infection and mini asthma forced us to take advantage of the local health care.  We tracked the hospital, where we were sent right to the pharmacy. The pharmacy is a hall in which it stood out of a hundred people in four queues. The following diagram:  Queue 1, to the doctor sitting behind the counter. Two words of interview (we only knew how to have asthma in Latin), coughing at the ear of the doctor, a few questions that we did not understand. Dr. wrote a note card, and a syrup and a weak salbutamol inhaler  Queue 2, window with the pharmacist who writes the order to the cash desk  Queue 3, cash register  Queue 4, collection of medicines  The whole action lasted from 20min, total cost about 2 Polish zlotys.  This story reminded me, because recently I visited several doctors, also privately, where the schema, where it hurts, aha, click a computer, a recipe to know. Privately the same, with the difference that at the beginning of the hand (wow) and necessarily, in two months for control :) After these few meetings Iranian schema of the first contact (although I can calmly refer to dermatologists, pediatricians, ENTs, because that's probably where the dr is behind the counter) seems to me to be outstanding in its simplicity, quickly, cheaply and the effect is identical or better, because after the use of drugs all the unpleasant symptoms have disappeared and we were enjoying this wonderful country peacefully.  #medycyna #iran #farmacja show the whole   +: coma24, adrian__ +8 others  ",2018-06-13 13:08:43,KrolWlosowzNosa,10,

You enter the town, you feel as if you are crossing a wall of stink. Everything is smoldering, everyone smokes in the ovens. There, even children scare the plant. From the earliest years I have heard (visiting): ""do not touch"", ""do not sit down"", ""do not move"" ... ""because it is soot"". This is a fact, the whole city is planted with soot. Where you do not touch, there's a black hand, dirty clothes. After a few days in this city, the skin becomes gray. You do not feel it yet, because you are staying in stench. After you leave your clothes, you smell them like they're sniffing.  #polska #smog #smieci #wysypiska #srodowisko #dolnyslask show the whole [see photo from 167.114.240.11]   +: benzdriver, Cronox  ",2018-06-10 12:08:32,turbogrosik,2,
81,"               #policy # 4connexions  Ladies and gentlemen,  today in the morning I was charmed by a puppet and so far I feel a great, unperturbed sore pain. Pain of a lawyer's ass. As the classic used to say, the club would go off. At this moment, I regret that I voted for those Bolsheviks and communists in the People's Republic of Poland. I could immediately draw someone from Kukiz, this is probably the most sensible party in the current parliament.  Well, yesterday you voted, under the guise of ecology (how they cut the Bialowieza Forest or banned windmills, they took the most care), a new tax thrown into the fuel. 10 cents per liter. It is of course a scandal and robbery in broad daylight, but in a moment, I will present a more interesting idea to those who are not interested in it.  Well, there was also a paid entrance to the cities - PLN 2.50 per hour. A fucking toll from which Tesle is released for half a bulb and some exotics, like a hydrogen car or CNG gas. Of course, because eco-black, smog, low emissions, etc. bujdy for nerds. Why am I writing bucks for suckers? Because CNG natural gas is in terms of the amount of combustion by-products emitted to the atmosphere, very close to the popular and well-known LPG in Poland. It's just that there are plenty of such vehicles in Poland, low-cost and widely available fuel, the mechanics are familiar with servicing installations for this gas. Adaptation of the engine under CNG is more expensive, and refueling stations are a drama. For example, only one works in Poznań.  So if it was about ecology, neither of these fuels would be admitted, or both would be allowed. In this way, the government bakes two birds with one stone: - they make money from us, because they have fooled people (and they still promise ...), and the budget is not from rubber, - throws people out of cities, or pushes them into buses and bikes, in accordance with the new neo-Marxist fashion, because why the plebs will get tangled on the roads. As soon as this law enters into force, the fleet of government limousines will soon change.  The centipede, however, is a national bard.

109,"  Portmanteau - a word cliché, word or phrase that is a combination of two or more words or expressions, usually of related significance. The combination of words or phrases from different languages ​​is called a hybrid (verbal, expressive, word-formation). #  Examples of compound words are the noun ""smog"" (a combination of two English words smoke, i.e. smoke, and fog), and the adjective ""variegated"" (combination of the words ""freakish"" and ""variegated""); Hybrid clusters are ""ciucholand"" and ""eco-food"". [...] George Orwell in the Year 1984 often used them to convey the absurdity of the described social relations (thoughtbrain, novelty). #  The words of the portmanteau in the meaning discussed here (the original ""trunk of the traveler"") was first used by Lewis Carroll in the book ""On the Other Side of the Mirror."" In Poland, one of the ""pioneers"" in this regard was Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz: his pseudonym Witkacy is a combination of the beginning of the name and half of the second name. #  Other examples of words that constitute word clusters are: gamification, netiquette, legis. #  #madreslowko show the whole   +: strumienzgor, long +7 others  ",2018-05-21 18:43:21,Deykun,9,

It's like spring, and here's a dick - tomorrow I take my garbage collection and my neighbor is not in the buckets any more, because from the morning I can not open the window with a capi from the chimney. The rain fell, I wanted to ventilate the cottage - I almost puked and coughed. Fuck him.  I moved to the village recently (before winter) and quite quickly visited the type, asking very nicely and culturally (though firmly) that he would not smoke garbage, because now children live here (practically for the peasant's house the developer put up the row houses) and we did not run away from it cities to continue to poison. The neighbor promised improvement - he said that ""he will not be here anymore"", so he admitted in vivid eyes that he had done it before.  The whole winter was in peace, and now he has been fucking since 6 am, I think the corpses in the stove are burning, thinking that everyone is asleep at this time and nobody is fucking up. The problem is that we do not sleep anymore, we only go to work, and then in the daytime the neighbor adds wood, smokes and pretends to be innocent, and from the chimney all the time with the fired crumb that got there.  What to do with it? I do not want to go to war with the type, because from the new neighbors (those who have moved in) as the ONLY I dared to talk to the peasant, so everyone just complained that it stinks, it's a pity to whore words. There are only old guards in the immediate area (grandfathers from the village), so if I call the municipal guards right now, it will be clear who has been drinking. I share a fence with my neighbor (every day is ""Good morning - Good morning"" and all in all) and I will share until the fucker does not die, so I do not want to have a scythe with him. We do not maintain any contacts, but seeing the snuffed snout (which will not even be greeted) by the fence for the next 20 years will be burdensome for me because we live very well with everyone around us. And whether the neighbor is normal or something will leave him - you never know either. ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯  PS. I will add that I was once again to talk to him, he did not even go to the gate (he pretended that the bell did not work), I only saw him looking through the window, so probably now it will not help or he will just deny everything . And then all the more he will be able to call SM after such an attempt to talk.  Any ideas? I take PLN 200 from you and put a good beer for solving the problem.

154,"               PiS is mistreated over its own electorate more than the entire opposition  What to say: in Pissk Poland, the most forgiven in many respects has the PiS electorate, which the party treats worse than the worst sort, still making him believe simultaneously in mutually exclusive things. For example, a PiS devotee must swallow sentences of the type: we were rewarded for hard work and therefore the president told us to give it to Caritas; smog will disappear when we have one million electric cars powered by coal-fired power plants; to enter 500+, it was not necessary to change the constitution, but to help parents with disabilities, it must be changed necessarily; when politicians fill the courts, the courts will be depoliticized ... and so on.  Is not it abuse of the electorate? What does the RPO do? Will no one in Poland ignore the tortured PiS voter?  Especially that the situation escalates. Here is one day the Law and Justice party speaks completely different things in his mouth: in Sucha Beskidzka, Kuchciński encourages the electorate to support the law depriving a woman of her right to defend her own life, to push her through the parliament as soon as possible, and in Lochock she claims that Kai Godek PiS has nothing to do with the ""inhuman project"".  President, pity, not everyone has Suski's circumferences, which do not overheat in any situation, because Suski is generally intellectually laid back and has no tension in him.  #polityka #bekazpisu #zajebanezfacebooka Kajetana Wróbleskiego #takaprawda show whole   +: k1fl0w, long_ +90 others  ",2018-04-24 15:00:52,Andreth,92,

I went to him because I did not think about what I like, only what is needed on the market. I earn on other things sometimes more, sometimes less, generally more than average. BUT! In Poland, for the family is a mega problem. And for all the others around: Finish studies, go to the corpo or the office and finish the retirement. Eat vitamin C. Buy a car with thirty airbags. Finally declare the girl. Drink water. Take ciprofen, mocomax, sun in a nutshell and vitamins. Gravity. Do not overload yourself. Buy an apartment. Do not ball. Come to church. Eat regularly. Do kids. Your sisters have a job, they have stabilized. Watch out for smog. So horrifying berets, I come home less often. Now about the girl - ... we're 2 years old. Everything seems to be cool, but interest - totally different. Some nails, clothes and a learned profession. And of course netflix. Boredom, burnout.  In this world of security and comfort, being relaxed, or God forbid taking risks - you are exposed to the MEGA BERET'S MARKET! From every side. I just had to write it, because there are pressures everywhere. I do not look into anyone's life and I thought it was coming back, but the advisers are everywhere. You can not go out for a beer, coffee, not to hear the accusation that I do not control my life. That I already missed the time to embrace myself, but I have a chance. What's most interesting is the majority of knowledge from Questions for Breakfast and special specialists in psychologists-sociologists from Dzień Dobry TVN. Interestingly, I do not know of any flatfish or anti-vaccine. If I was still on foil, I do not know.  P.S. Ehh, I will come back to being humble anyway, and I will partly do what others expect of me, trying to find myself in all this. I am a freethinker ...

178,"               Smolensk catastrophe. 24 conspiracy theories  1. Conspiracy of Tusk and Putin on the Sopot pier The assassination of President Lech Kaczyński was to be prepared jointly by the then Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk and Russia, Vladimir Putin.  2. The theory of two visits The separation of the visits of Donald Tusk and Lech Kaczyński is of key importance here. ""If the visits were not separated, the tragedy would not happen"" - said Jarosław Kaczyński many times.  3. The theory of disregarded signals The report ""Who will answer Smolensk"" (2015) states that the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by Radosław Sikorski, was aware that Kaczyński's visit would be less secure. Such information was to be transmitted by the Russians to the Polish side. BOR and special services even received signals of a potential coup, but abstained from actions. This information was to concern, inter alia, planning by a ""certain group"" of a frontal plane abduction policy of one of the European Union countries.  4. Coup in Georgia The beginning of the activities that led to the ""Smolensk assassination"" was the shooting of Lech Kaczyński's convoy in Georgia in 2008. The presidents of Poland and Georgia went to Ossetia to see Lech Kaczyński seeing that the Russians are also stationed in places where, according to the peace agreement, they are stationed should. The report ""28 months after the catastrophe"" states: ""The Georgian case showed that even in the event of a threat to the president's life, politicians from the PO, the Internal Security Agency and the main media are ready to accuse the President and blame him for the situation he has become a victim and defend Russian policy . The same method of operation was applied after April 10, 2010 "".  5. The theory of shale gas If there was a coup, there must have been a motive. And the motifs are. One of them even economical: shale gas. Lech Kaczyński, as a supporter of shale gas extraction in Poland, posed a great threat to the Russian gas market.  6. President Kaczyński as a barrier The political motive was more important. The proof of how uncomfortable Lech Kaczyński was for Putin are the famous words of the Polish president: ""Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, and later maybe Poland."" In the introduction of the report ""Who will answer Smolensk?"" Antoni Macierewicz writes: ""The evidence is unambiguous: no one more than the rulers of the Russian Federation took advantage of the death of the President of the Republic and the elimination of the foundation of Poland's independence policy. There is no doubt that the current expansion of Russia to the West would not be possible if President Kaczyński lived and if his political line were continued. ""  7. The theory of Szuladziński's internal explosion and the proof of a sausage One of Macierewicz's experts, Dr. Grzegorz Szuladziński, came to the conclusion that the TU-154M board had an ""internal explosion"". In his opinion, this is evidenced by the lack of fire and the type of hull cracks. If the explosive was outside the aircraft, the effects would be different. Dr Andrzej Ziółkowski from the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences supported this argument using sausages as an illustration. The longitudinal rupture of the hull had to be the result of a rapid increase in pressure due to an explosion inside the aircraft. ""We see something like that when we cook sausages for breakfast,"" he said and showed a picture of two sausages cracked along the entire length.  8. The theory of Binienda's weird wing Another supporter of the theory of explosion, prof. Wiesław Binienda, said at a conference organized at the Poznan University of Technology that the explosive was placed outside the Tupolev. ""The Tu-154 plane was higher than 50 meters above the ground at the time of loss of the wing. It is impossible for him to collide with a birch tree. We think a linear explosive has been placed on the wing, ""he said in an interview with"" The Times. ""  9. Theory of a multi-point explosion Professor Jan Obrębski (Warsaw University of Technology) is of the opinion that splitting the Tupolev into many parts ""is not possible as a result of a simple fall"". If it were just a fall, the plane would behave like a ""thin-walled can hit with a wooden hammer"" - which illustrated a crushed can of an energy drink. He claims that there has been a multi-point explosion.  10. Gmyza trace of TNT Journalist Cezary Gmyz in the text ""Trotyl on the Tupolev wreck"" in ""Rzeczpospolita"" claimed that traces of explosives that remained on the plane, testify to the explosion and action of third parties (as a consequence of this publication he lost his job, which was supported by the followers of Smolensk mythology additional proof that he was right).  11. The theory of a thermobaric bomb Proponents of this theory argue that the explosion occurred not in the air, but after landing the plane in Smolensk. It was a thermobar bomb: first, a small explosion caused the spray inside the aircraft to be aerosol, and then the fuse caused its ignition and explosion. The basis of this theory is the presence of trace amounts of zirconium, which were to be found in the soil at the crash site and are used in this type of bombs.  12. Helium theory at the airport At Heler airport, helium was released, as a result of which the airplane's carrying force decreased and therefore fell too fast. Advanced by Rafał Rogalski, plenipotentiary of the families of some victims of the Smolensk catastrophe, helium theory is still popular on internet forums.  13. Theory of artificial fog The theory of artificial fog is similar. It was supposed to be sprayed by the Russians. Antoni Macierewicz spoke in 2011. ""Suddenly fog came out, witnesses say. We do not know where from, after all, it was not in any forecast, nothing foretold it, and suddenly everything was obscured. "" Artificial fog next to the birch is one of the symbols of the conspiratorial explanation of the Smolensk catastrophe.  14. Bromsky theory of terrorist attack Another expert Macierewicz, Stefan Bromski, presented an extensive concept of a ""terrorist attack"". Terrorists sprayed ""artificial smog"" over Smolensk, and then, using a radio signal, they launched a bomb in the air.  15. Theory of a factory defect The disaster was to be caused by the factory defect of Tupolev. It is not known, however, what this defect was supposed to depend on. It was not repaired, because the presidential plane before the flight to Smolensk was put into service by a company cooperating with the Russian services. A further-reaching version of this theory assumes the deliberate damage to the plane by a Russian company servicing Tupolev.  16. The theory of disinformation Russian navigators intentionally confused Polish pilots, giving incorrect data to prevent a safe landing. This is similar to the appointment of the commission of Jerzy Miller (minister of the interior), who in the report of September 2011 accused the manager of the landing zone of the Smolensk airport that he was giving erroneous commands to the crew of the aircraft. In conspiracy theory, however, the key is the belief that this was a deliberate action.  17. The theory of poison Passengers of the TU-154M were poisoned during the flight. Theory is popular especially on Internet forums. However, it has not been clarified. Were the pilots poisoned and therefore crashed? Are all Tupolev passengers poisoned? How?  18. The theory of twin aircraft The wreck, which lies in the forest near Smolensk, is not an airplane that took off from Warsaw on 10 April. President Tupolev was shot down earlier, and another landed. Where did the remains of the passengers come from? This theory would also need to be supplemented.  19. The theory of irrelevant birch A small tree, which grew 855 meters before the beginning of the landing strip, is ironically called ""armored birch"". Birch has been the subject of much discussion during meetings of the Macierewicz team or the famous Smolensk conferences. The message of supporters of the Smolensk plot was one - it is impossible for the birch to cause the Tupolev disaster. And the claims of the previous authority and its experts that it was so are aimed at concealing the truth. In this way, the birch has become the symbol of ""Smolensk's lie"".  20. The theory of wounding the wounded On April 9, 2013, the day before the third anniversary of the Smolensk catastrophe, Antoni Macierewicz said at the meeting with voters that ""(...) after years of research, I can say with a great deal of certainty and probability that the reports that three survivors are reliable . ""  21. The theory of punching Evidence for this theory is provided by videos circulating on the web, on which the remains of the plane can be seen, and from afar you can hear shots and voices (in Russian) encouraging to shoot.  22. Sabotage of investigators Strong proof of the Smoleńsk attack and the plot against President Kaczyński is to be the way of conducting the investigation by the Miller commission. The charges include the lack of visual inspection at the scene of the accident, the unexplored wreckage of the Tupolev wreck, and the cooperation with the Russian MAK - the commission that first developed the report on the disaster.  23. The theory of disgracing corpses The proof of the desire to hide the truth was a panicky haste in identifying the corpses of the victims. The day after the catastrophe, Ewa Kopacz - then the Speaker of the Sejm - was replaced by a doctor. There are many videos on the Internet showing how the Kopacz changed the relationship about how the body was examined and what was the role of Polish pathomorphologists at the crash site. [In fact, there were errors, including replacing the body of Anna Walentynowicz].  24. The theory of the mystery of bodies The bodies of victims, hastily identified, carelessly buried, can hide a secret that reveals the roots or manner of the attack. Therefore, the investigating prosecutor's office on June 21, 2016 decided to exhume all corpses of the victims of the Smolensk disaster, which were not cremated. The will of the family does not matter.

192,"               Inspired by the dictionary of urban activist concepts, I decided to fill in the market gaps and issue a dictionary for other residents of the city:  Dictionary of the Polish driver's terms  Highway - the basic goal of the evolution of every street in Poland, also in the city or suburbs. The sky of drivers, for whom the poor who can not afford a steel horse have no access. Driving below 150km / h (because you know, the counter is distorting - see Counter) is severely punishable on the motorway with the flashing lights and the driver's bad mood behind you.  Shopping Center - the only place in the area that understands the needs of the driver, in which he can settle all his needs, not being bestially forced to walk over distances greater than 100m.  Cyclist - idiot, uses muscles to move, thinks that he has wheels, he is allowed to drive along the way. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Whatever the situation, the fault is on his side.  Pedestrian zone - a space brutally torn from the reach of cars, despite the age-old traditions (a little over 100 years) of access to cars everywhere. Given to the poor who can not afford cars.  DDR (bicycle route) - the best parking spaces in the area.  Supplier - an experienced driver who knows exactly what he can and can not do: You can do everything, you can not disturb. It is also worth copying the protagonist of our times, support of the economy: without looking after your health and turning your employer over with some work safety tips, risking life under the fire of leftist pedestrians, cyclists and elderly ladies, delivering rolls, ham, etc.  Diesel - crude power, ranges, the most economical combustion in the world (maybe even bigger than the average urban gasoline, but who does not need a 3l engine to the city ?!). The plot of manufacturers of electric motors, pedal lpg and leftist scientists saying some nonsense about PM10 and pollution is nonsense. A real driver does not need oxygen to operate, the real driver breathes exhaust fumes.  Road - the realm of drivers, space reserved for cars. Any violation of this space will be severely punished with a horn, flashing lights and spoiled humor of the driver.  Ambulance - the best way to get through traffic jams, if other suckers are going to get lost (see Life Corridor)  Life corridor - as the name suggests, a corridor created so as not to lose the life in traffic jams. A way to quickly evacuate the cork, whether on the highway or in the middle of the city.  Counter - a funny form of measuring and limiting the freedom of drivers. A really nasty device that ALWAYS distorts the speed to the driver's disadvantage. Probably in a conspiracy with cyclists and urban activists.  City - a collection of points with small distances from each other, which should be connected by motorways, but unfortunately they are not.  Parking - any place that is not a road. The conspiracy of cyclists, national parks, left-wing city activists and the fact of existence of buildings has significantly reduced this space for years under different appearances. The fight continues.  Pedestrian - the only person on the road, who is allowed more than you (because in case of a collision they will take you right away). Evil Incarnate, created by God Almighty to test the patience of drivers. Pedestrian traffic should ultimately be channeled, let out in tunnels, so that their paths never intersect the roads of cars, without disturbing the Holy Passage (see Bandwidth). The underground is a good place for lower life forms.  Regulations - only pedestrians and cyclists are in force. Not you.  Priority - you have them always, unless Kamaz is driving.  Bandwidth - nirvana, perfect throughput, a world in which there are no pedestrians, cyclists, city activists and speed bumps.  Pedestrian crossing - cheeky rape on the path of the road, where the left-wing leftist conspiracy and the non-government faction of city activists introduced the priority of the poor over the nobility in cars, ravishing something about the laws of physics, security and urban planning (slogans invented just to make trouble life of drivers). As you know, every pedestrian crossing totally paralyzes traffic, de facto turning it around, which completely destroys the Holy Passage (and here it is worth mentioning the propaganda of falsehood, for example, studies that like pedestrian crossings do not affect the capacity in cities, but the person who she wrote she probably never experienced the ecstasy of driving on the highway)  Bike - the greatest evil of the world. It requires using muscles to move (CO K ## $ # AA?!? !!!?) And is often used to wickedly enter the sacred realm of drivers (see Road). For the sake of this filth, often belts are removed from the roads for cars (with the accompaniment of some leftist rubbish). A person who walks in this evil incarnate is colloquially called ""Pedalist"" (see Cyclist), because you know, you wear tight trousers, hehe.  Car - The purpose of human existence. You drive it always and everywhere, regardless of distance, weather, comfort and well-being.  Smog - a by-product of driver's freedom. Nothing in the world is free, but it's a low price for FREEDOM (screaming eagle in the background).  Sklepik - senseless places, mainly due to the fact that they are scattered in the distance in which the engine does not warm up between stops. And with every need to look for a parking space !! Some idiot designed it. As for the needs of drivers, it is the opposite of shopping centers.  Municipal police - fat bucks. Instead of chasing pedestrians and cyclists for entering from the realm of drivers (see Road), they hunt for the spirit of guilty drivers, who were forced by life to leave the cozy interior of the car for 10 minutes.  Road bike - the biggest evil of the world to the power of N + 1. Apparently it requires a relatively smooth surface for driving, and yet such large wheels have that even a plowed field should be able to drive. Mainly owned by krypto (and not only) homosexuals who fancy photos in tight gigs on the Internet.  Emergency Lights - a funny name for a parking button wherever you want.  Zatoka - another form of parking (see Parking), convenient, because roadside. Due to the conspiracy of the left and collective mob transport, regulations were created limiting the use of this type of parking, but these rules can be circumvented with the help of the ""parking anywhere"" button (see Emergency Lights)  West - a mythical space, which is called by city activists and cyclists. What did they see movies from the US? It is obvious that highways with 16 lanes in one direction are the future.  #rower #transport #car #od # # # # # # # # # # #   +: DanielPlainview, rimyi +114 others  ",2018-04-05 17:09:09,qwarqq,116,
193,"               Dictionary of the concept of an urban activist  Highway - every street on which you can drive at a speed of 30 km / h. Post one of its belts to a green belt, build up moderators and pedestrian crossings (see the pedestrian crossing) every eight meters.  Metal plates - deadly machines invented by the Germans to kill old people (see older person) and to smudge children with smog (see smog). Legend has it that the metal plates were invented by Hitler to gas all inhabitants of the planet. If you do not exterminate the metal plates at all times, Hitler will win.  Participatory budget - a budget to which you can report your traffic calming projects (see traffic calming) to help local residents. If the local residents protest against your projects and do not want to vote for them, apparently their brains have been washed out by the metal lobby (see blachosmród).  Promenade - postulate turning every possible street into a pedestrian street. If a street is actually turned into a promenade, do not visit it to see if revitalization made any sense - after all, you have achieved your goal.  DDR - bicycle route. If there is not one street, it should be loudly demanded to build it. Once they build it, it should be stated that ""it is uncomfortable"", possibly ""incompatible with the regulations"", and continue to roam the bike on the road.  Diesel - the worst type of metal organ (see blachosmrod), which was designed to primarily poison the elderly (see older person) and pregnant women. Every diesel owner spends at least five hours a day on laboriously cutting the DPF filter (not to be confused with PDF, you like PDFs, because you write your projects in the participatory budget [see participative budget]) to poison more effectively.  Supplier - the worst creep. He parks his hideous tin body (see blachosmrod) in the middle of the pavement, instead of how a normal man bring to the store (see shop) three hundred kilos of goods from a parking lot located two hundred meters away (see parking) or - as in the West (see West) - bring goods with a cargo bicycle. Photograph him and throw him on the Internet, and then break off his windows and punch the tires.  Ambulance - privileged metal plate. But not entirely - if somebody comes to save the old woman (see older person) and blindly sets footpath, throw him on the Internet, and then knock out the windows and pierce the tires.  The city - is for people. Remember that drivers are not people, only metalworkers (see blachosmród).  Motorist - the king of activists, can ram a dozen or so plates, block and plug a few intersections. Its main item is the bell, it rings like a lion on a safari and shows its superiority and power, usually ringing begins the ritual of ramming sheet metal.  Parking - a space appropriated by metal roofers, which in the West (see the West) would have long ago been transformed into a green area, where one could spontaneously meet. It is enough, however, to remove from the word ""parking"" the name of the bank advertised by Marek Kondrat and it will be perfect.  Pedestrian - the only person on the road, which is allowed more than a cyclist. Repeat that ""we are all walking"" and that ""pedestrians are the least protected users of the road"". If the pedestrian goes through a four-lane street, it is a sign that there should be a pedestrian crossing (see pedestrian crossing). If it goes red - it's a sign that red took too long. ATTENTION! When a sheet metalman will want to give out reflections to the pedestrians so that they are more visible, lighter him and ban the dung.  Pedestrian crossing - holy zone. The driver approaching the pedestrian crossing should slow down to minus fourteen kilometers an hour, get out of the car and politely ask all the surrounding pedestrians, if he can cross them, and then manually push the car to the other side. Cyclists can of course ride the length and breadth of walking, pedaling between pedestrians, because the bike has less weight and never ever hurts pedestrians.  Regulations - only the tinseries are in force (see blachosmród). Not you.  Bike - the most wonderful means of transport in the world. You love him so much that you would like to ride a bike. You drive it always and everywhere, regardless of the weather, comfort and well-being. Well, unless it's cold, it's raining a little or just your stomach hurts.  Car - see blachosmród.  Sklepik - beautiful, small, charming places that have been slaughtered by disgusting discounters. Repeat how important they are to you and how important it is to help local entrepreneurs. But if one of them comes under his shop with a metal plate (see blachosmrod), to deliver the goods, upload his picture to the Internet and demolish his car. After all, he can ride a cargo bike.  Smog - a monster coming out of metal plates (see blachosmrod). Strangles, causes all diseases of the world, ultimately kills. Remember that smog causes ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY metal plates. The lobby is trying to squeeze you in, that most of the smog is covered by old stoves and rubbish, but fortunately you know the truth.  Older person - most people treat older people as normal road users. Do not make this mistake. You know very well that every old person can not see or think or have a clue what he is doing, so you must protect her so that you do not harm her (see Blachosmrod). Well, unless an ambulance (see ambulance) comes to save her and set footpath - then photograph her and throw her on the internet, and then demolish.  Municipal police - fat bucks. They did not answer any of the one hundred and forty-eight reports of poorly parked cars you sent to them today on their way to work, even though you were able to capture someone standing on two wheels on the sidewalk, thereby completely blocking the passage for octopuses and people above four meters.  Road bike - a bike that gives the user a god mode and a license to blow the rules. If there is a bicycle path next to it (see DDR), and you have a road bike, follow it along the road and show it on the Internet. When someone notices you, copy and paste the following text: ""I am riding a road bike, I practice for racing, I can not go for DDR"". If you answer ironically ""and I practice for the rally, so I will drive two buds in the built-up"", remove his comment and ban the dung.  Tram - Emperor among transport, with its presence can block the entire intersection, traffic on the whole street. Shows where is the place of the algae (see the metalman). It has ramming and killing abilities, it is run by a driver (see roofer) has the ability to ram, ring, but never brakes, never give up.  Traffic calming - construction of jumpers, slackers, ""lying policemen"" and other obstacles, thanks to which the roadway will look like an obstacle course and can not be treated as highways (see motorway). If someone tells you that it will increase the smog (see smog) and make it difficult to work to the services (see ambulance), delete his comment and ban the dung.  West - a mythical space, namely Scandinavia, where there are no metal plates, suppliers, couriers and paramedics drive cargo bikes, and all residents do nothing but spontaneously meet on a soy latte and talk about their bikes.

205,"               #track #hardry #smog The new road sign ""Clean transport area"" appeared in the draft amendment to the regulation on road signs and signals. This is another proof of the imminent restriction of entry to city centers. The necessity of introducing new signs defining the boundaries of the Clean Transport Zone results from the act on electromobility adopted this year. Article 39 of the Act allows local governments to establish in the city centers zones to which only vehicles powered by electricity, hydrogen or natural gas could enter freely. The remaining vehicles would be subject to a 30-zloty fee. Interestingly, according to the law, local governments already have the right to establish such a zone, although there are still no official regulations that would allow it to be properly labeled. This means only one thing - paid entry to city centers is a priority, which is why the regulations were passed at a fast pace, forgetting the details. For failure to comply with the new road sign, i.e. entering the clean transport zone without authorization or paying the appropriate fee, a fine of 500 PLN will be in danger. show the whole source: Strefa_czystego_transportu_znaki.jpg   +: maattteo, DanielPlainview +2 others  ",2018-03-29 21:37:49,sargento,4,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_zbDPxlQy4QwtncUeC4GkZdDDzfYYFPcU,w400.jpg""/>"

211,"               The municipality did not measure air pollution this year. When distributing subsidies for the replacement of heating sources, he will be able to support other data.  At the end of last year, the municipality announced that research should be carried out to help determine the most vulnerable parts of the city. Measurements were to be made at 56 places in Łódź - four times in each of them. Thanks to this, the municipality would know better if the activities carried out bring the desired effect, and the air quality improves. The data was also supposed to help in the distribution of subsidies for the exchange of heating sources: the money would be directed mainly to places where smog makes life more difficult.  But although the winter has just come to an end, the measurements have not been carried out. - To be reliable, we would have to have quite stable weather for about a month and a half. But that was not the case - explains Krzysztof Honkisz from the department of environmental protection. And emphasizes that companies interested in carrying out measurements also paid attention to the lack of appropriate weather conditions. That is why 150,000 PLN, which was recorded this year for measurements, will be used for other purposes. What? The authorities of Łódź will decide about this.  Honkisz emphasizes, however, that the municipality will benefit from other support when distributing subsidies. It will be data prepared by the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection. A special map will be developed for those points where the municipal council planned to conduct measurements.

However, nobody says ""grows up on what"". And you know what? Looking at how the opposition (if it can be called that now) is discredited, Paweł Kukiz ridicules, and #dobrazmiana very willingly pours orders, bans, taxes, prohibition of trading on Sunday, ban drinking under the cloud, distribution 500+, passivity on the smog (they introduced a law that does not change anything about the quality of coal), additional subsidies for the Torunian priest and many other rubbish rights, but I am glad that I did not grow up from Korwin.  Out of this whole swamp, only the old, good-looking Corvine is still the same, and more precisely ""like a cow that never changes his views like him"" as a man said about not understanding the first freshness.  Therefore, looking at this whole circus, I'm glad that I did not grow out of it. At the moment, if there were to be elections, I really would not have anyone to choose, because it would be like choosing between diarrhea and hardening. Law and Justice? Socialists under the cover of the ""right wing"". PSL? Like a fly that sticks constantly to this constipation. Kukiz? Apparently the party sometimes does something, but the leader is weak and often plays as PiS will play. Together? Send them together to the DPRK or to Cuba.  And so is Korwin, who sometimes starts his system ""always a bit ..."" called or ""an anti-threshold system"", but he still thinks the same, you know what to expect from him and really wants good for the country, he can not do it "" to sell.

393,"               Can someone explain to me why on days such as today, when the south of Poland is all covered with smog, and standards are exceeded by 1000% no one announces an alarm? No warnings in the media, no press releases? Absolutely nothing?  Out of curiosity, I checked the WIOŚ website from Katowice. The last message says that February 28 was bad air and that at the beginning of March will also be bad.  I checked the WIOŚ website from Krakow. Last message from February 16. I will not comment on this.  We're going on, WIOŚ Warszawa, the last communication of February 6. Regarding waste ...  I also entered passwords in google such as smog alert, smog alarm, etc., nothing left me warning for today.  Fuck, after all, it's some heavy embarrassment. Nobody treats this subject seriously, and THE ENTIRE POLISH SOUTH IS SOUGHT IN THE SOMOGUE. And they all have a hard hatchet.

If you were running a business, would you also curse in negotiations with clients? - In fact, I DREAM (skumovina, imposter), how much will you spare from this price? - As I said, with a contract for a year, the price is PLN 60. - &&% $ ^ # ... you prefer to sell nothing than to leave the price. - Right attention, but this is about the profitability threshold below which I can not go down, even if I wanted to, because my boss and logic does not allow me. - You do not understand anything! - Then let the Lord look at it from the other side. You run a business and sell a product for PLN 40, whose production / purchase costs PLN 20. The client comes, puts 10 zlotys on the counter and says: sell me Lord! You know that it is below the cost of production / purchase, so you prefer not to sell than to sell and lose. Truth? - I would think (he did not understand). It's a matter of profitability. - NO JUST and it does not pay us to go below certain prices, especially since they are already low. I hear that the Lord understood. - You do not understand anything! Please, call the owner of the company! - I am not authorized to provide his number. Besides, I'm responsible for contact with clients. (Anyway, it still warms eggs somewhere in the Canary Islands or other Philippines). - & ^ & ^% & * #! I'm going to the competition they have the same for 10 zlotys. - Great offer, it will be difficult to break it. Why in that case do you want SUCH SERVICE for PLN 40? - ... ... ... ...

You do not understand anything ... NOT TO SEE!  I will skip the fact that it would probably be possible to sell it a little cheaper, but the boss said how much of a minimum and he has no mercy. For something leasing a new cart has to be paid, for skiing and under the palms to ride and still me (unarmed) and one hundred something to give away. I've heard about the principle that companies are falling out of lack of profit and lack of turnover, but what can I do? Sam, I have to pay extra to sell to that?

437,"               I did not have plans for the weekend, but my friends invented a trip to Krakow. Well okay, why I have not been recently, and it's only 3.5 hours by car. They drove on Friday morning by train, while I arrived after work by car. One but. Their main point was the museum in Oświęcim. They did not seem to be told by anything that it was winter, it was quite cold, and there it was not enough that the cold whistled it was probably a flock of ""hikers"" who would love the time. No and uj Okay, let it be. On Sunday morning, I pack everyone in the car, go to the six, and begin a gentle reminder of history and a small digression about the current assault on the Polish Nation for imaginary crimes against the Jews. With their own opinion on this subject, on average, typical of young people. Well, nothing, we arrived after a one-hour drive. We were after 8am, and it has already happened with 8 buses. Until now I was in camp in Lublin (Majdanek), so more or less I knew what and how. My great surprise was the metal detectors. But what to be surprised. After all, in Poland, so many madmen, every second with a knife, and every tenth with a shahid belt (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) I laughed stupidly, but what is not done for an imagined sense of security for people from the chosen nation. Oh, I could not have a backpack with me, even though I only had water there. Normally, I felt like I was at least entering the space shuttle. Well, okay, we went inside the crowd of people with strange hats on their heads. These people literally moved away from us, they were afraid of us, I just do not know why. They looked with horror at my boots (which make me great boots for all weather - in a word I'm not dirty metal (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)). Well, but I did it, I focused on the descriptions on the walls, where the descriptions of the martyrdom of the Soviet soldiers and, of course, the chosen people prevailed. I think it was only in the third building that delicate descriptions about the Poles began. How was our ancestors killed too ?! None of the crowds beat us, did not want to kill us, their over-dented bodyguards did not have anything to us either - in this respect, the little patches are coloring. However, there was a situation that made me happy. Why? Because she opened my eyes to my friends, that not everything looks like they say in tvn and they write in newsweek. We enter one of the rooms where there was a group of Jews, along with a guide who spoke something in Polish (I was surprised, though it is probably normal that Jews with a history connected with Poland often learn our language). Well, but nothing, we enter ... and there was complete silence. The gorilla raised his backside from the radiator, the guide fell silent, and the whole room of people looked at us. 10 seconds of grave silence ... and suddenly the guide continues as if nothing had happened, but in a language unknown to us. What's up is not even me. I turned to the wall, reading some descriptions, and they were babbling in Yiddish. Well, an interesting situation that surprised me and my friends showed that it is not the Poles who are guilty of fault for all the discord between our nations. Well, but nothing, all in all just the punch line of my post was supposed to be a somewhat comic situation preceded by a deathly silence. Ps: I was very disgusted that the building with the description of Polish martyrdom is practically at the end of the 'trail', when everyone is tired and only a few are looking there. Of course, the aforementioned trips bypass the wide arch of the exhibition devoted to Poles, Belgians and the Dutch. After all, they were only victims. Oh, and their trips look like they're fucking up with a guide who says so quickly like you from the advertising of drugs, descriptions nobody reads, even though they are in several languages. Because what for. Probably they were still hangover, because on Saturday evening we met such a group in Krakow.

442,"               I asked the city office what they do to make the air in the city better. I also asked for reliable results. It turned out that such results do not (or do not want to provide). I will add that the town has about 60,000 inhabitants, north of Poland. My questions: 1. How does the city hall fight against polluted air in the city? 2. How many people have been punished for improper smoking in the previous or current year? 3. How many flats / houses that had ovens could be connected to municipal heating in 2017? And how much does the city plan in 2018? 4. What, according to the office, is the reason for such poor air condition in the city?  1. Here a lot of generic phrases like:    - thermal insulation of public buildings,   - that they are trying,   - clean the roads (?),   - cycling policy,   - soot trees.  2. Answer the attached picture. There were quite specific numbers here. I do not know if the seats total 900 zlotys, or 10 households got a fine of 900 zlotys each.  3. And here is a farce. No numbers, no goals. They did not even give how many applications for co-financing for the gas boiler / replacement of the old furnace were made.  4. Here they answer that it is very good indeed, because measurements were made and the city is in the forefront of the least polluted cities in Poland. It is a pity that the measuring device was on an unfused street near garden plots. (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)  Naturally, I asked for specific numbers, because they must have them, each city has them, only you have to want to (count the applications, apartment houses, etc.). I am waiting for a response.  P.S. I naturally passed 1% of the tax for @Watchdog_Polska will be from PLN 100 per cup.

Then the concentration of PM10 exceeded there ... 80 micrograms per cubic meter.    In Poland, such values ​​are achieved practically every day - and nobody is interested in them. In Kielce, only pollution at the level of over 400 (!) Micrograms caused any reaction. At the same time - such values ​​have reached both PM10 and even more dangerous PM2.5.    YES - it is many times worse with us and NIKT NOTHING WITH THIS, and we are staying. And do not think to yourself that if you do not leave the apartment, it does not concern you - IN FLATS, THIS DUST CUMULATES, so while sitting inside you can breathe even more than outside!
