Instead of 500+, it can be used for heating, a surcharge of 6000 PLN per stove and not for a child. Because at such a pace the child will not live to 18th birthday in this air ...

54,"  https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wielki_smog_londy%C5%84ski    Great Smog of London - a smog created in London from December 5 to 9, 1952, created due to weather conditions and emitted gases into the atmosphere, mainly from chimneys of flats, factories and car exhausts.   Smog has led to environmental disaster and the deaths of thousands of Londoners. Most of the victims of the great smog died of lung failure and hypoxia. In addition, a very high concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere led to severe damage to the respiratory system and permanent damage to the bronchi, which in turn resulted in a deadly harvest among the inhabitants of London [1].    At the beginning of December London was haunted by dense fog and significant cooling of the air. As a result, the inhabitants of London consumed much larger than usual amounts of coal for heating apartments. The inversion of temperature also hampered the spread of polluted air outside the city. The air was contaminated with large amounts of gases and dust from coal combustion. An additional problem was the low quality of the coal used, which resulted in a lot of harmful substances getting into the atmosphere.

Once every two years, an 'environmental' survey is carried out, which checks the composition of the exhaust with a special device. And so this year they got info that this is the last year where they can use this boiler. The exhaust norm exceeded by 6%.  They have choices for electricity or gas and time until the end of December 2019. No one protests, everyone understands the concept of the common good even at the expense of taking credit for this investment. How could we poison others, they ask?

86,"               Wrocław continues to amaze me. I moved here two years ago - until today, this city amazes me in terms of the extremes of feelings that it evokes in me.  On the one hand, it's just a damned pretty city. At the same time (which for me personally is a big plus), I have the impression that everything is close to Wroclaw as we are near the center. A lot of climatic places, a lot going on in terms of music / culture - I can not complain about that. For people the same - somehow I'm lucky and I'm getting to those kind of people who have a normal human approach rather than debaters who want to bring people to their own low level.  On the other barricade? Smog, a lot of dirt, architectural rozpierdol, broken roads, traffic jams, problem with collective transport.  But I have the greatest extremes in terms of what is hard to verify with data: climate. Because something is in this city, it is an uncountable ""something"". Though it may have been in my love for Wroclaw, my mother comes from here and she always talked about him warmly.  NADODRZE.  This is where I used to go when I was in college. This is where I live now and it is Nadodra who I meet from a different angle. It's morning - the time I reorganized totally in relation to how mornings looked when I worked regularly. I am training now in the morning, going out for a little walk and possibly shopping to gain strength for the day. Well, I'm visiting. I enter the streets which I have never seen, I am looking for places that might interest me, I find inscriptions, murals, architectural wonders and ... And I have extreme feelings (ಠ_ಠ)  I go through the square of Saint. Maciej, I am looking at tenement houses, I pass people and I try not to notice how much pollution the city is feeling. I come to ul. St. Wincentego and I see the street in all its glory. Ah, this architectural rozpierdol. In the background, the chimneys of the power plant, in the middle of which, in the closest plan, the building is totally unsuitable for the rest in the style of a manor house, and in the nearest plan, tenements stretching along the street. Some are shabby, while others are renovated in their own way. The picture perfectly shows the extreme of feelings, the more that in its entirety - it has its own indescribable atmosphere.  I take a picture, I go further down the street and notice the gate with a whole painted with a specific mural - it's a signal to look here, and if I can find a place to rent for a workshop or some interesting place. Passing through the gate I enter a completely different atmosphere of Wroclaw. Opposite me, Ekocentrum - a bizarre building that is architecturally totally incompatible with the whole yard, but it is quiet here, quietly, I would say that it is amazingly nice. I see the next inscriptions, murals and again feel a strange atmosphere, this time completely positive, a change about the degree of what I saw with the chimneys of the power plant in the background.  And so it is often here - the more yards I see, the more I notice this architectural rozpierdol of Wroclaw which nobody controls and which is perhaps our national domain - we probably have not been able to preserve any continuity in construction, not counting urban markets for decades.  I'm smoking a cigarette, I'm going to Ptasia, to a small marketplace where often older people run their businesses, and I can buy fresh vegetables, sometimes a flower from my grandma who probably broke him at home and wants to earn some extra money. Now in the winter there are almost none, but in the spring or summer I can buy for a few zlotys freshly fragrant without, which can not be so easily found in a big city.  A strange atmosphere. And at the same time, I still feel good here, despite all the chaos that has been taking place in my life. I learn Wroclaw anew, I am convinced that it is worth coming along the Oder, that Osobowicka also has a few strange unique places to which I can return and I make sure that the worst period in the city is winter. And she passes and soon it will be really beautiful here.  #dziendobry #rozkminkrzaka #opowiadanie #milegodnia #wroclaw show the whole source: IMG_20190120_161053.jpg   +: vanitydomain, hansrey +45 others  ",2019-01-21 12:12:27,bkwas,47,"<img class=""block lazy"" data-original=""https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_rCZC77QQATwKKhop2I4Dw46F4HVOg6DD,w400.jpg""/>"

Let everyone heat whatever they like and how they like it, I also smoke whatever they are and now the eco-lovers are constantly talking about smog, dragon, it used to be, even worse and somehow people lived. 2. I smoke with garbage and anything, I am not surprised at all that people do it too, we can not afford a better source of heating by the state and the economy. 3. I smoke so much and it does not bother me that others do it, because all in all, my impact on this environment is small and you need to warm up. Poland is not Germany or Scandinavia that makes good money there and become people for eco-heating. 4. The fact bothers me what to do, I can not afford gas heating, no extra charge 5. I try to heat it so that it is not harmful, but others do, but I do not do anything about it. 6. I warm up organically, or I try and admonish my neighbor if he smokes rubbish or other shit. 7. Ecologically warming up or I am trying and reporting my neighbor for pale or other services like burning piles or anything. 8. I am an ardent eco there, promote eco heating, despise with poisoning, and take part in anti-smog patrols and make others aware of others etc. etc. 9.
